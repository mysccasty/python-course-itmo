                               CHAPTER I
                        PSYCHOLOGY AND FICTION


Few words attract us like the word psychology. It has the call of the
unknown, the lure of the mysterious. It is used and heard so frequently
that it has come to have a definite connotation, but the individual
who is asked to say what it is finds it difficult either to be exact
or exhaustive. Psychologists themselves experience similar difficulty.
Psychology means the science of the soul, but we have no clearer
conception of the soul today than Aristotle had when he wrote his
treatise on it.

Professor Palmer states that William James once said that psychology
was “a nasty little subject,” and that “all one cares to know lies
outside.” Doubtless many who have far less knowledge of it have often
felt the same way. The present fate of psychology, or the science of
mental life, is to be handled either as a department of metaphysics, or
as subsidiary to so-called intelligence testing. The few remaining true
psychologists are the physiological psychologists and a small group
of behaviourists. In this country Woodworth, who takes the ground of
utilising the best in the arsenal of both the intro-spectionists and
the behaviourists, and calls the result “dynamic psychology,” leads the
former; and Watson the latter.

Psychology has no interest in the nature of the soul, its origin or
destiny, or in the reality of ideas. Nor does it concern itself with
explanation of mental phenomena in terms of forces which can neither
be experienced nor inferred from experience. It is concerned with the
facts of mental life and with describing, analysing, and classifying
them. When it has done this it hands the results over to the logician
who occupies himself with them from a purposeful rather than a causal
point of view; and he makes what he may of them, or he puts them at the
disposal of fellow scientists who use them to support conjectures or to
give foundation to theories.

It is universally admitted that when we want to get a true picture of
human life: behaviour, manners, customs, aspirations, indulgences,
vices, virtues, it is to the novelist and historian that we turn, not
to the psychologist or the physiologist. The novelists gather materials
more abundantly than the psychologists, who for the most part have a
parsimonious outfit in anything but morbid psychology. Psychologists
are the most indolent of scientists in collecting and ordering
materials, James and Stanley Hall being outstanding exceptions.

Fiction writers should not attempt to carry over the results of
psychological inquiries as the warp and woof of their work. They
should study psychology to sharpen and discipline their wits, but
after that the sooner they forget it the better. The best thing that
fiction writers can do is to depict the problematic in life in all
its intensity and perplexity, and put it up to the psychologists as a
challenge.

In the fifty years that psychology has had its claims as a science
begrudgingly allowed, there have arisen many different schools, the
most important of which are: (1) Those that claim that psychology is
the science of mental states, mental processes, mental contents, mental
functions. They are the “Functionalists.” There is an alternative to
the consciousness psychology--the psychology of habit--touched on
its edges by Professor Dewey in “Habit and Conduct.” And (2) those
that claim the true subject matter of psychology is not mind or
consciousness, but behaviour. They refuse to occupy themselves with
“consciousness,” and for introspection they substitute experiment and
observation of behaviour. Their theoretical goal is the prediction and
control of behaviour. They are the “Behaviourists.” The literature
infused with interest in psychological problems--fiction, criticism,
and to a small extent social economics--has little connection with
the older psychology based on subjectivities, except as it takes over
the vagaries of technique and terminology of the psychoanalysts. The
literature of greatest merit seems to avail itself most profitably of
definite psychological materials when it turns to the behaviourist
type. Indeed, it is with this school that the novelist most closely
allies himself. Or it was, until the “New Psychology” seduced him.

This last school claims that consciousness and all it implies is
a barren field for the psychologist to till. If he is to gather a
crop that will be an earnest of his effort, he must turn to the
unconscious, which we have with us so conspicuously eight hours out
of every twenty-four that even the most benighted recognise it, and
which is inconspicuously with us always, looking out for our self- and
species-preservation, conditioning our ends, and shaping our destinies.

The New Psychology, which is by no means synonymous with the teachings
of Dr. Sigmund Freud of Vienna, regards the human mind as an intricate
and complex mechanism which has gradually evolved through the ages
to suit the needs of its possessor. The adaptation has, however, not
been perfect, and the imperfections reveal themselves in frequent,
startling, and embarrassing lapses from the kind of mind which would
best enable its possessor to adjust himself to the conditions and
demands of modern civilisation. It recognises that it deals with a
mind which sometimes insists upon behaving like a savage, but which is
nevertheless the main engine of the human machinery, human personality,
from which society expects and exacts behaviour consistent with the
ideals of advanced civilisation. The practical psychologist realises
that he has to cope with this wayward mind, and if he is to be of
service in effecting a reconciliation between it and the requirements
of civilisation, he cannot ignore it, spank it, or coerce it by calling
it bad names. He must understand it first; then he may train it. The
trouble with the New Psychology, whether it is “New Thought” or one of
the mutually antagonistic schools of psychoanalysis, is that it almost
inevitably runs off into what James terms “bitch-philosophy.”

Through this tangled web of vagaries there is a thin thread of
work that is not only fiction, but literature; and this is usually
characterised by obvious parade of psychological technique.

Just as civilised man's body has been evolved gradually from more
primitive species and has changed through the various stages of
evolution to meet the changing conditions of the environment and
necessities, so has his mind. In this advance and transformation
the body has not lost the fundamental functions necessary for the
preservation of the physical being. Neither has the mind. But both
the body and the mind, or the physical and psychical planes of the
individual, have been slowly developed by environment and life in such
a way that these fundamental functions and instincts have been brought
more and more into harmony with the changing demands of life. This
process, outwardly in man's circumstances and his acts, inwardly in his
ability to shape one and perform the other, constitutes civilisation.
It is doubtful if the instincts are quite as definite as some of our
professors, McDougall and his followers, claim, and they lack utility
when used as a basis for social interpretation either in essays or
fiction.

Dr. Loeb's forced movements as a basis for a structure of interests
is far more plausible. It is the interplay of interests, rather than
of instincts, which is the clay our practical activities are pottered
from, and should be the reliable source of materials for literature.
Whenever fiction cuts itself down to instincts it becomes ephemeral as
literature.

The two fundamental and primitive instincts of all living organisms,
civilised man included, are the nutritional urge and the creative urge,
or the instinct of self-preservation and that of the preservation
of the species. To these there is added, even in the most primitive
savages, the herd instinct, which leads men to form groups or tribes,
to fight and labour for the preservation of them, and to conform to
certain standards or symbols of identification with the tribe. The
Freudians do not recognise the herd instinct as anything but sublimated
bi-sexuality, attributing the tendency to regard the opinion of
one's associates to the psychic censor, instead of to an instinct.
These three instincts are recognised in their commonest and most
normal expression today as the tendency to provide for oneself and
one's family; the tendency to marry and rear children under the best
conditions known; and the tendency to regard the opinion of one's
associates and to be a consistent member of the social order to which
one acknowledges adherence.

It is small wonder, then, that the realist and the romanticist, whose
arsenal consists of observation and imagination, find in narration of
dominancy and display of these instincts and tendencies the way to
the goal for which they strive: viz., interest of others, possibly
edification. Certain novelists, Mr. D. H. Lawrence for instance, pursue
discussion of the fundamental ones with such assiduity and vehemence
that the unsophisticated reader might well suspect that life was made
up of the display and vagaries of these essences of all living beings.
But without cant or piety it may be said there is such a thing as
higher life, spiritual life, and readers of psychoanalytic novels must
keep in mind the fact that the Freudian psychology denies the reality
of any such higher life, accounting for the evidences of it which are
unescapable in terms of “subliminations,” such as “taboos.” Though
these three instincts form the basis upon which the whole of man's
mental activity is built, they by no means form its boundary. At some
prehistoric period it is possible that they did, but during countless
ages man's mind has been subject to experiences which called for other
mental activity than the direct and primitive expression of these
urges, and he has had to use his mental machinery as best he could
to meet these demands. He had no choice. He could not scrap his old
machinery and supply his mind with a new equipment better fitted to do
the complex work civilisation demanded.

The result is that the working of these instincts on the experience
presented to the mind has brought about innumerable complications.
These are known in the New Psychology as mental complexes. They have
been to some modern novelists what the miraculous food given to Israel
in the Wilderness was--their sole nutriment. Complexes, or conflicts
resulting from adaptation of the primitive mental machinery to more
intricate and varied processes than those with which it was originally
intended to cope, determine much of man's mental life.

To understand the workings of a mind is like trying to unravel a
tangled skein of thread. The two main difficulties are: (1) That up to
this time our mental training, our perceptions, our consciousness, our
reason, have been exercised for the specific purpose of maintaining
ourselves in the world. They have not been concerned with helping us
to understand ourselves; (2) That there are parts of our minds whose
existence we do not recognise, either because we will not or because
we cannot, for the reason that they have come to be regarded as being
in conflict with other parts which we have long admitted as having
the first claim to recognition. In other words, not having known how
to adapt certain parts of our mental machinery to the newer purposes
for which we needed them, we have tried to suppress them or ignore
them. In doing so we have only deceived ourselves, because they are
still connected up with the main engine and influence all of the
latter's output, harmoniously or jarringly--sometimes to the extent of
interfering seriously with its working.

The work of the practical psychologist is to learn how to overcome
these two difficulties and to teach others how to use the knowledge.
This is the task novelists frequently set themselves, and some,
Willa Cather in “Paul's Case” and Booth Tarkington in “Alice Adams,”
accomplish it admirably. Like the teacher and the priest, they have
learned that surplus energy of the mind may be diverted from the
biologically necessary activities into other fields of useful and
elevating effort. They have learned that the second difficulty can be
best overcome by facing the truth about our minds, however unpleasant
and unflattering it may at first sight appear to be. Recognition
of the existence of the two primitive urges, the instincts of
self-preservation and of the preservation of the race, is the first
step toward appreciation of their reasonable limitations and the extent
to which they may be brought into harmony with the requirements of a
well-balanced life.

This leads us to refer for a moment to a tremendous force which, in any
discussion of the working of the instincts, cannot be ignored. It is a
constant effort or tendency, lying behind all instincts, to attain and
maintain mental, emotional, and spiritual equilibrium. The tendency is
expressed by the interaction, usually automatic and unconscious, which
goes on between complexes and tends to establish the equilibrium. At
the same time the working of individual instincts tends to upset it.
Whenever the automatic process is suspended to any great degree, as by
the cutting off from the rest of the mind of one complex, the result
is a one-sided development which causes mental disturbances and often
eventually mental derangement. As the instincts and complexes incline
to war among themselves, there is a stabilising influence at work
tending to hold us in mental equilibrium and thus to keep us balanced
or sane. No one in the domain of letters has understood this force and
its potentialities like Dostoievsky. “The Possessed” is a chart of that
sea so subject to storm and agitation. The effort toward integration
is perhaps a true instinct, and rests on a sound physiological
basis, so well described by Sherrington. It furnishes a genuine theme
for description of life's activities, and well-wrought studies of
integration and disintegration take highest rank in fiction.

With all their prolixity, the Victorian novelists managed to depict
progress in one direction or another. This is more than can be said of
most modern novelists, who are exhausted when they have succeeded in
a single analysis, and commit the crass literary error of seeking to
explain, when all that the most acute psychologist could possibly do
would be to catch at a pattern, a direction, and an outcome, as mere
description--problem rather than explanation being the dramatic motive.

While the novelist's business is to see life and his aspiration is to
understand what he sees, many novelists of today are, by their work,
claiming to understand life in a sense that is not humanly possible.
Human conduct affords the best raw material for the novelist. If he
represents this in such a way that it seems to reflect life faithfully
he is an artist; but the psychological novelist goes further and feels
bound to account for what he represents. Ordinarily he accounts for
it in one of three ways: (1) by the inscrutability of Providence--as
many of the older novelists did; (2) by theories of his own; (3) by
the theories of those whose profession to understand life and conduct
he accepts. In short, he must have a philosophy of life. The mistake
many novelists are making is to confuse such a philosophy of life with
an explanation of mental processes and a formula for regulating them.
Neither philosophy nor psychology is an exact science. If a novelist
wishes to describe an operation for appendicitis or a death from a
gastric ulcer, he can easily get the data necessary for making the
description true to fact. But if he aspires to depict the conduct,
under stress, of a person who has for years been a prey to conflicting
fear and aspiration, or jealousy and remorse, or hatred and conscience,
what psychologist can give him a formula for the correct procedure?
Who can predict the reactions of his closest friend under unusual
conditions?

With our earnest realistic novelist ready to sit at the feet of science
and avail himself of its investigations--prepared, as Shaw would say,
to base his work on a genuinely scientific natural history--there is
danger of his basing it, too, upon psychology which is not “genuinely
scientific,” because its claims cannot be substantiated by experience.
While the novelist is in such a receptive state along comes a
scientist, hedged also with that special authority which physicians
possess in the eyes of many laymen, and offers the complete outfit of
knowledge and (as he assures the novelist) inductively derived theory
that the novelist has been sighing for. This is Freud. He or his
disciples can explain anything in the character and conduct line while
you wait. If you want to know why a given person is what he is, or why
he acts as he does, Freud can tell you. His outfit is not, ostensibly,
“metaphysical,” like much of the older psychology that our novelist
encountered in college days. It is human, concrete, and surprisingly
easy to understand. A child can grasp the main principles. Our novelist
tests out a few of them on life as he has known it and finds that they
seem to work. If he is not completely carried off his feet, he may
grin at some of the formulas as he might at a smutty joke, but his own
observations concerning the excessively mothered boy and his reading of
some of the great dramas of the world are to him sufficient evidence
of their soundness; and he bases the behaviour of his characters upon
them with the same assurance of their accuracy that he would have in
basing the account of a surgical operation and its results upon the
data supplied him by a surgeon who had successfully performed hundreds
of exactly similar operations and watched their after effects.

One of the rudimentary instincts of human nature is curiosity, an
urge to investigate the unknown, the mysterious. It is mystery that
constitutes romance. It is the unknown that makes romance of one's
future, fate, fortune, mind--at least that part of the mind which
we do not understand and which is always taking us by surprise and
playing us tricks. Curiosity is forced movement developed along the
lines of interest. It is quite likely to follow the line of least
resistance, and just now there is little resistance to sex curiosity.
Those who find fascination in the New Psychology today found the
old psychology of a quarter of a century ago a stupid bore. The old
psychology dealt exclusively with what is now called the “conscious
mind:” with analysing the concept of directed thought, with measuring
the processes of the mind which we harnessed, or believed we harnessed,
and drove subject to our wills to do our work. The old psychology was
academic, dry, as proper and conventional as the C Major scale, without
mystery, without thrills, and therefore without interest, except to the
psychologist.

The New Psychology is different. And this “difference” is exactly why
it has proved to be almost as effective bait to the feminine angler
after romance which may serve her as caviar to the prosaic diet of
every-day existence as are spiritualism and the many other cults and
new religions whose attraction and apparent potency are now explainable
by what we understand of this very psychology--or the science of the
mind. There is no reason to suppose that the current doctrines of
the subconscious will do more for civilisation or art than the older
doctrines of consciousness. The fact that they seize the popular fancy
and are espoused with enthusiasm is of no particular significance,
since the very same attitude was an accompaniment of the older
doctrines.

It would be difficult to exaggerate the prevalent interest in
psychology. I shall cite three indications of it: The pastor of one of
the large and influential churches in New York asked me a short time
ago if I would give a talk on Psychology before the Girls' Club of his
church. When I suggested that some other subject might be more fitting
and helpful, he replied that all the girls were reading books on
psychology, that he was sure none or few of them understood what they
read, and that he was convinced that their indulgence was unhealthy.
Should one go into any large general book-shop in New York or elsewhere
and survey the display, he will find that a conspicuous department
is devoted to “Books on Advanced Thinking,” and upon inquiry he will
find that it is the most popular department of the store. The most
uniform information that a psychiatrist elicits from the families of
youths whose minds have undergone dissolution is that for some time
previous to the onset of symptoms they displayed a great interest in
books on philosophy and psychology, and many of them had taken up
psychoanalysis, or whatever passes under that name; joined some League
of the Higher Illumination; or gone in for “mental fancy work” of some
kind.

Before taking up specific illustrations of psychology in modern
fiction, I wish to say to amateurs interested in the study of
psychology, that frank recognition of their own unconscious minds or
of the part of their instinctive life or memories which may have been
intentionally or automatically pushed out of consciousness, does not
call for digging into the unconscious through elaborate processes
of introspection or through invoking the symbolism of dreams. Even
were it done, the result would probably reveal nothing more startling
than would a faithful account of the undirected thoughts which float
uninvited through the mind during any idle hour. For most normal
persons such thoughts need neither to be proclaimed nor denied.
The involuntary effort toward equilibrium of a normal mind will
take adequate care of them. The study of such mental conditions and
processes in abnormal individuals, however, is often of great service
to the psychologist and facilitates understanding of the workings of
both the normal and the unbalanced mind.

I also desire to call attention to the value of an objective mental
attitude if one would conserve mental equilibrium and keep the working
mind at its highest point of health and productivity. One of the
greatest safeguards of mental equilibrium is the desire for objective
truth. This is an indication that the mind is seeking for harmony
between itself and the external world, and it has a biological basis
in the fact that such harmony between the organism and the external
world makes for security. The desire for objective truth is a straight
pathway between the ego-complex and the ideal of a rational unified
self. Parallel with this rational self there is an ethical self which
has freed itself from the complexes caused by the conflict between the
egoistic instincts and the external moral codes, and uses the rational
self to secure harmony of thought and action based on self-knowledge.
These two ideals may be pursued consciously and may be made the main
support of that complete and enlightened self-consciousness which is
essential for the most highly developed harmonious personality.

For a time it seemed to the casual observer that the New Psychology
was so steeped in pruriency that it could not be investigated without
armour and gas mask. Happily such belief is passing, and many now see
in it something more than the dominancy and vagaries of the libido,
which convention has insisted shall veil its face and which expediency
has suggested shall sit at the foot of the table rather than at the
head. It has awakened a new interest in the life of the spirit, which
is in part or in whole outside consciousness, and it has finally
challenged the statement of the father of modern psychology, Descartes:
“I think, therefore I am.”

The religionist advises us to “Get right with God.” At least he is
bidding for integration of interests. The humanist in literature who
tries to get life going right with its memories is doing the same
thing. To be on good terms with memory is happiness; to be on bad terms
with it is tragedy. Both are fields for literary workmanship. The more
the individual works up his memories in contact with his experiences,
the more objective he becomes. On “Main Street” everybody remembers
everything about everybody else and thinking becomes objective, with
aspects no finer than the daily experiences of the thinkers. There is
no chance for romance and adventure because the memories of the few
who erred by embarking on adventurous ways are so vivid in the minds
of their neighbours, and so often rehearsed by them, as to inhibit the
venturesome. Instead of mental equilibrium between vital and struggling
interests, there is only inertia. This makes a good theme for a
sporadic novel, but it is not a basis for a school of novelists. Mr.
Lewis set himself a task that he could perform. On a level where life
is richer and memories are crowded out by sensational experiences the
task is harder.

It is a mistake to think that psychology is all introspection and
conjecture of the unconscious. Mental life in the broadest sense is
behaviour, instinctive and intelligent. Few have shown themselves
more competent to observe, estimate, and describe such behaviour than
the author of “Main Street.” That novel was a study of temperament, a
portrayal of environment, and an attempt to estimate their interaction
and to state the result. It was recognised by those who had encountered
or experienced the temperament and who had lived, voluntarily or
compulsorily, in the environment, to be a true cross-section of life
focussed beneath a microscopic lens, and anyone who examined it had
before him an accurate representation of the conscious experiences
of at least two individuals, and a suggestion of their unconscious
experiences as well. This permitted the reader, even suggested to
him, to compare them with his own sensations and ideas. Thus it was
that emotions, sentiments, and judgments were engendered which, given
expression, constituted something akin to public opinion. The result
was a beneficence to American literature, for the purpose of the writer
was known, and it was obvious to the knowing that he had accomplished
it.

In “Babbitt” Mr. Lewis set himself a much more limited task. The
picture is life in a Middle Western city of the U. S. A. It is as
accurate as if it had been reflected from a giant mirror or reproduced
from a photographic plate. George F. Babbitt is signalled by his fellow
townsmen as an enviable success from a financial and familiar point of
view. Nevertheless he grows more discontent with life as prosperity
overtakes him. The burden of his complaint is that he has never done a
single thing he wanted to in his whole life. It is hard to square his
words with his actions, but he convinces himself. So having run the
gamut of prosperity, paternity, applause, wine, women, and song--in his
case it is dance, not song--without appeasement, he finally gets it
vicariously through observing his son who not only knows what he wants
to do, but does it. He summarises what life has taught him in a few
words: “Don't be scared of the family. No, nor of all Zenith. Nor of
yourself, the way I've been. Go ahead, old man! The world is yours!”

Mr. Lewis' purpose was to describe the behaviour of a certain type of
man in a certain kind of city, of which the world is full. He gives the
former a definite heredity, an education with an amalgam of sentiment,
a vague belief that material success spells happiness, that vulgar
contact with one's fellows constitutes companionship, and that Pisgah
sights of life are to be had by gaining a social elevation just beyond
the one occupied. Then he thwarts his ambition to become a lawyer with
an incontrovertible outburst of sex and sentimentality, and all his
life he hears a bell tolling the echoes of his thwarted ambition. He
feels that he has been tricked by circumstance and environment, and
that display of chivalry to his wife and loyalty to his chum were
wasted. They were indeed, for they had been offered, like the prayers
of the hypocrites, in clubs and in corners of the street, and displayed
for his own glory.

Materialism was Babbitt's undoing. It destroyed the framework on which
man slings happiness and contentment, and which is called morality and
idealism. When that went he became a creature of Mr. Karel Capek's
creation. Mr. Babbitt, in common with countless benighted parents,
cherished a delusion. He believed that filial love, so-called, is
an integral part of an offspring's make-up. It is an artefact, an
acquisition, a convention: it is a thing like patriotism and creed.
One is born with a certain slant toward it and as soon as he becomes
a cognisant, sentient organism he realises that it is proper to
have it and to display it. In fact he is made to do so during his
formative years; thus it becomes second nature. And that is just what
it is--second nature. Parental love is first nature. If this were a
disquisition on love, instead of on novelists, I should contend that
there are two kinds of love: a parent's love for its child, especially
the mother's; and a believer's love for God. When Mr. Babbitt wallows
in the trough of the waves of emotion because he doesn't get the
affection and recognition from his children which is his due, he
alienates our sympathy and Mr. Lewis reveals the vulnerable tendon of
his own psychology.

Were I the dispenser of eugenic licenses to marry, I should insist that
everyone contemplating parenthood should have read the life history of
the spider, especially the female of the species, who is devoured by
her offspring. All novelists should study spiders first-hand. Filial
love, or the delusion of it, furnishes the material for some of the
finest ironies and deepest tragedies of life, and as Mr. Lewis adopts
it as a medium for characterisation quite free from the teaching of
the Freudians who would make it a fundamental instinct, the reader is
entitled to expect from him a more reasonable treatment of the subject.

Babbitt's tragedy in the failure of his children's affection is the
tragedy of millions of parents the world over. There is hardly a note
that would be more sure of wide appeal. But it cannot be explained by
the mere fact that, despite the Decalogue, no person of reason will
ever “honour” where honour is not merited. It is hard to pity Babbitt
because he could not commandeer the filial respect and honour which he
had failed to inspire. If this were all, the situation would be simple.
But, like countless other deluded parents, Babbitt believes that
merely by bringing children into the world he has staked out a claim
on their love, just as the child has a claim on the love of those who
brought him into the world. And in this belief lies the irony and the
tragedy: in the disparity between tradition and fact; between reason
and instinct. The tradition or convention that filial love corresponds
to parental love probably had its origin in the mind of the parent who
would have liked to supply the child with such reciprocal instinct--a
love that would transcend reason and survive when respect and honour
had failed--but nature has not kept pact with the parental wish. In
the realisation and acceptance of the truth lies the Gethsemane that
each parent must face who would mount to higher heights of parenthood
than the planes of instinct. Hence the universal appeal: the reason
why the reader sympathises with Babbitt even while condemning him.
He has forfeited the right to what he might have claimed--honour and
affection--to fall back upon more elemental rights which were a figment
of the imagination. Mr. Lewis' psychology would have struck a truer
note if he had differentiated more clearly between the universal parent
tragedy and Babbitt's own failure as a parent.

With the regeneration or civic orientation of Babbitt I am not
concerned--that is in the field of ethics. But, as a student of
literary art and craftsmanship, it seems to me the sawdust in Mr.
Lewis' last doll.

To depict the display of Babbitt's consciousness as Mr. Lewis has done
is to make a contribution to behaviourism, to make a psychological
chart of mental activity. One may call it realism if one likes, because
it narrates facts, but it is first and foremost a narrative of the
activities and operation of the human mind.

“Babbitt” may be construed as the American intelligence of Mr. Lewis'
generation turning on its taskmaster. All men who live by writing, and
have any regard for fine art and “belles lettres,” or any ideals for
which, in extremity, they might be willing to get out alone with no
support from cheering multitudes and do a little dying on barricades,
live and work with the Babbitt iron in their souls. Mr. Lewis probably
had his full dose of it. He had been an advertising copy-writer,
selling goods by his skill with a pen, to Babbitts, and for Babbitts.
He had been sub-editor for a time of one of those magazines which are
owned and published by Babbitts and tricked out and bedizened for a
“mass circulation” of Babbitts. He hated Babbitt. When he saw the
favourable opportunity he meant to turn Babbitt inside out and hold
him up to scorn. But Mr. Lewis is not savage enough, and his talent is
not swinging and extravagant enough, and he has not humour enough, to
make him a satirist. He is a photographic artist with an incomparable
capacity for the lingo of “one hundred per cent Americans.” As he
gets deeper and deeper into the odious and contemptible Babbitt,
he begins to be sorry for him, and at the end he is rather fond of
him--faithfully telling the facts about him all the while. He pities
Babbitt in Babbitt's sense of frustration by social environment and
circumstances, and admires him for telling his son not to let himself
be similarly frustrated.

To call such a book “an exceedingly clever satire” and its leading
character “an exceedingly clever caricature” is, it seems to me, to
confess unacquaintance with one's countrymen or unfamiliarity with
the conventional meaning of the words “satire” and “caricature.” Such
admission on the part of the distinguished educator and critic who has
recently applied these terms to it is most improbable.

If a photograph of a man is caricature and a phonographic record of his
internal and externalised speech constitutes satire, then “Babbitt” is
what the learned professor says it is.

There is a type of novel much in evidence at present called
psychological, which is reputed to depict some of the established
principles of psychology. It should be called the psychoanalytic
novel, and psychoanalysis is only a step-child of psychology. There
are hundreds of such novels. Some of them are considered at length
later. Here I shall mention only one; “The Things We Are,” by John
Middleton Murry. The story is of a young man, Boston by name, who has
been unfitted for the experiences of adult life by excess of maternal
love--the most familiar of all the Freudian themes. The narrative is
developed largely through description of successive states of mind
of the subject, with only the necessary thread of story carried by
recounting outward events. After the death of his mother, Boston finds
himself unable to take hold of life and dogged with a sense of the
futility of all things. He tries various kinds of uncongenial work as
cure for the sense that life is but a worthless experience, all of
which fail. Finally he retires to a suburban inn to live on his income,
and there, through the kindly human contact of the innkeeper and his
wife, he experiences the awakening of a latent artistic impulse for
expression and narration. He finds himself believing that he could
give years to becoming the patient chronicler of the suburb which has
provided him such beneficial retreat. Even his small peep at community
and family life gives Mr. Boston uplift and expansion, and makes more
significant the greatest of the Commandments. He sends for his one
London friend, a literary man, who brings with him the young woman to
whom he is practically engaged. The recently released libido of Mr.
Boston focusses and remains focussed upon her. He interests her and
finally wins her, and the long “inhibited” Mr. Boston finds himself
in “normal” love. The environment prepared him and “he effected a
transformation” on Felicia--in the language of the psychoanalyst.
The thesis of the story is that for this particular kind of neurotic
suffering, “suppression of the libido,” cure lies in “sublimation of
the libido,” best effected by art and love in this case, after work,
social service, and religion have been tried and failed.

The psychology of the sick soul is a science in itself, and is known
as psychotherapy. There are many sick souls in the world--far more
than is suspected. Very few, comparatively, of them are confined in
institutions or cloistered in religious retreats or universities. The
majority of them toil to gain their daily bread. They are the chief
consumers of cloudy stuff and mystic literature. The purveyors of the
latter owe it to them not to deceive them about psychoanalysis. As a
therapeutic measure it has not been very useful. The novelist should
be careful not to give it more potentiality for righteousness than it
possesses.

It is the history of panics, epidemics, revivals, and other emotional
episodes that they always recur. The present generation is fated to
be fed on novels embodying the Freudian theories of consciousness
and personality. Like certain bottles sent out from the pharmacist,
they should have a label “poison: to be used with care.” The contents
properly used may be beneficial, even life saving. They may do harm,
great harm. Freudianism will eventually go the way of all “isms,” but
meanwhile it would be kind of May Sinclair, Harvey J. O'Higgins _et al_
to warn their readers that their fiction is based on fiction. A man's
life may be determined for him by instincts which are beyond the power
of his reason to influence or direct, but it has not been proven. It is
hypothesis, and application of the doctrine is inimical to the system
of ethics to which we have conformed our conduct, or tried to conform
it, with indifferent success, for the past nineteen hundred years.

It is often said that man will never understand his mate. There
are many things he will never understand. One of them is why he is
attracted by spurious jewels when he can have the genuine for the same
price. Ten years ago, or thereabouts, a jewel of literature was cast
before the public and was scorned. I recall but one discerning critic
who estimated it justly, Mr. Harry Dounce. Yet “Bunker Bean” is one of
the few really meritorious American psychological novels of the present
generation. It is done with a lightness of touch worthy of Anthony
Hope at his best; with an insight of motives, impulses, aspirations,
and determinations equal to the creator of “Mr. Polly”; and with a
knowledge of child psychology that would be creditable to Professor
Watson.

There are few more vivid descriptions of the workings of the child mind
than that given by Mr. Harry Leon Wilson in the account of Bunker's
visit to “Granper” and “Grammer,” and the seduction of his early
childhood by the shell from the sea. Dickens never portrayed infantile
emotions and reactions with greater verisimilitude than Mr. Wilson when
knowledge of the two inevitables of life--birth and death--came, nearly
simultaneously, to Bunker's budding mind.

If journals whose purpose is to orient and guide unsophisticated
readers, and to illuminate the road that prospective readers must
travel, would give the “once over” to books when they are published
and the review ten years later, it would mark a great advance on the
present method. If such a plan were in operation at the present time
“Bunker Bean” would be a best seller and “If Winter Comes” would be
substituting in the coal famine.

Force or energy in a new form has come into fictional literature within
the past decade, and I propose to consider it as it is displayed in
the writings of those who are mostly responsible for it: James Joyce,
Dorothy Richardson, Marcel Proust, and to consider some of the younger
English novelists from the point of view of psychology.




                              CHAPTER II
           IRELAND'S LATEST LITERARY ANTINOMIAN: JAMES JOYCE

    “The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a
    life does it spring.”--STEPHEN DÆDALUS.


Ireland has had the attention of the world focussed on her with much
constancy the past ten years. She has weathered her storms; she has
calmed her tempests; and she is fast repairing the devastations of her
tornadoes. None but defamers and ill-wishers contend that she will
not bring her ship of state successfully to port and that it will not
find safe and secure anchorage. During her perilous voyage one of her
rebellious sons has been violently rocking the boat of literature. His
name is James Joyce and his craft has had various names: first “The
Dubliners,” and last “Ulysses.”

A few intuitive sensitive visionaries may understand and comprehend
“Ulysses,” James Joyce's mammoth volume, without previous training
or instruction, but the average intelligent reader will glean little
or nothing from it, save bewilderment and disgust. It should be
companioned with a key and a glossary like the Berlitz books. Then
the attentive and diligent reader might get some comprehension of Mr.
Joyce's message, which is to tell of the people whom he has encountered
in his forty years of sentiency; to describe their behaviour and
speech; to analyse their motives; and to characterise their conduct.
He is determined that we shall know the effect the “world,” sordid,
turbulent, disorderly, steeped in alcohol and saturated with jesuitry,
had upon an emotional Celt, an egocentric genius whose chief diversion
has been blasphemy and keenest pleasure self-exaltation, and whose
life-long important occupation has been keeping a note-book in which he
has recorded incident encountered and speech heard with photographic
accuracy and Boswellian fidelity. Moreover, he is determined to tell
them in a new way, not in straightforward, narrative fashion with a
certain sequentiality of idea, fact, occurrence; in sentence, phrase,
and paragraph that is comprehensible to a person of education and
culture; but in parodies of classic prose and current slang, in
perversions of sacred literature, in carefully metred prose with
studied incoherence, in symbols so occult and mystic that only the
initiated and profoundly versed can understand; in short, by means of
every trick and illusion that a master artificer, or even magician, can
play with the English language.

It has been said of the writings of Tertullian, one of the two greatest
church writers, that they are rich in thought, and destitute of form,
passionate and hair-splitting, elegant and pithy in expression,
energetic and condensed to the point of obscurity. Mr. Joyce was
devoted to Tertullian in his youth. Dostoievsky also intrigued him.
From him he learned what he knows of _mise en scene_, and particularly
to disregard the time element. Ibsen and Hauptmann he called master
after he had weaned himself from Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas. But
he calls no one master now; even Homer he calls _comare_. It is related
that “A.E.” once said to him, “I'm afraid you have not enough chaos in
you to make a world.” The poet was a poor prophet. Mr. Joyce has made a
world, and a chaotic one in which no decent person wants to live.

It is likely that there is no one writing English today who could
parallel his feat, and it is also likely that few would care to do it
were they capable. This statement requires that it be said at once that
Mr. Joyce has seen fit to use words and phrases which the entire world
has covenanted not to use and which people in general, cultured and
uncultured, civilised and savage, believer and heathen, have agreed
shall not be used because they are vulgar, vicious, and vile. Mr.
Joyce's reply to this is: “This race and this country and this life
produced me--I shall express myself as I am.”

[Illustration: JAMES JOYCE]

An endurance test should always be preceded by training. It requires
real endurance to finish “Ulysses.” The best training for it is careful
perusal or reperusal of “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” the
volume published six or seven years ago which revealed Mr. Joyce's
capacity to externalise his consciousness, to set it down in words.
It is the story of his own life before he exiled himself from his
native land, told with uncommon candour and extraordinary revelations
of thought, impulse, and action, many of them of a nature and texture
which most persons do not feel free to reveal, or which they do not
feel it is decent and proper to confide to the world.

The facts of Mr. Joyce's life with which the reader who seeks to
comprehend his writings should be familiar are: He was one of many
children of South Ireland Catholic parents. In his early childhood his
father had not yet dissipated their small fortune and he was sent to
Clongowes Wood, a renowned Jesuit College near Dublin, and remained
there until it seemed to his teachers and his parents that he should
decide whether or not he had a vocation; that is whether he felt
within himself, in his soul, a desire to join the order. Meanwhile he
had experienced the profoundly disturbing impulses of pubescence; the
incoming waves of genesic potency had swept over him, submerged him,
and carried him into a deep trough of sin, from which, however, he was
extricated, resuscitated, and purged by confession, penitence, and
prayer. But the state of grace would not endure. He lost his faith, and
soon his patriotism, and he held those with whom he formerly worshipped
up to ridicule, and his country and her aspirations up to contumely.
He continued his studies in the Old Royal University of Dublin,
notwithstanding the abject poverty of his family. He was reputed to be
a poet then, and many of the poems in “Chamber Music” were composed
at this period. He had no hesitation in admitting the reputation,
even contending for it. “I have written the most perfect lyric since
Shakespeare,” he said to Padraic Colum; and to Yeats, “We have met too
late; you are too old to be influenced by me.” If belief in his own
greatness has ever forsaken him in the years of trial and distress that
have elapsed between then and now, no one, save possibly one, has heard
of it. Mr. William Hohenzollern in his sanguine moments was never as
sure of himself as Mr. James Joyce in his hours of despair.

After graduation he decided to study medicine, and, in fact, he did
pursue the study for two or three years, one of them in the medical
school of the University of Paris. Eventually he became convinced that
medicine was not his vocation, even though funds were available for
him to continue his studies, and he decided to take up singing as a
profession, “having a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice.” These three
novitiates furnished him with all the material he has used in the
four volumes that he has published. Matrimony, parentage, ill-health,
and a number of other factors put an end to his musical ambitions. He
taught for a brief time in Dublin and wrote the stories that are in
“Dubliners,” which his countrymen baptised with fire; and began the
“Portrait.” But he couldn't tolerate “a place fettered by the reformed
conscience, a country in which the symbol of its art was the cracked
looking-glass of a servant,” so he betook himself to a country in the
last explosive crisis of paretic grandeur. In Trieste he gained his
daily bread by teaching Austrians English and Italian, having a mastery
of the latter language that would flatter a Padovian professor. The war
drove him to the haven of the expatriate, Switzerland, and for four
years he taught German, Italian, French, English, to anyone in Zurich
who had time, ambition, and money to acquire a new language. Since the
Armistice he has lived in Paris, first finishing the book which is his
_magnum opus_ and which he says and believes represents everything that
he has to say or will have to say, and he is now enjoying the fame and
the infamy which its publication and three editions within two years
have brought him.

As a boy Mr. Joyce's cherished hero was Odysseus. He approved of
his subterfuge for evading military service; he envied him the
companionship of Penelope; and all his latent vengeance was vicariously
satisfied by reading of the way in which he revenged himself on
Palamedes. The craftiness and resourcefulness of the final artificer of
the siege of Troy made him permanently big with envy and admiration.
But it was the ten years of his hero's life after he had eaten of the
lotus plant, that wholly seduced Mr. Joyce and appeased his emotional
soul. As years went by he realised that his own experiences were
not unlike those of the slayer of Polyphemus and the favourite of
Pallas-Athene, and after careful deliberation and planning he decided
to write an Odyssey. In early childhood Mr. Joyce had identified
himself with Dædalus, the Athenian architect, sculptor, and magician,
and in all his writings he carries on in the name of Stephen Dædalus.
Like the original Dædalus, his genius is great, his vanity is greater,
and he can brook no rival. Like his prototype, he was exiled from
his native land after he had made a great contribution to the world.
Like him, he was received kindly in exile, and like him, also, having
ingeniously contrived wings for himself and used them successfully, he
is now enjoying a period of tranquillity after his sufferings and his
labour.

“Ulysses” is the record of the thoughts, antics, vagaries, and
actions--more particularly the thoughts--of Stephen Dædalus, an
Irishman, of artistic temperament; of Leopold Bloom, an Irish-Hungarian
Jew, of scientific temperament and perverted instincts; and of his
wife, Marion Tweedy, daughter of an Irish major of the Royal Dublin
Fusiliers stationed in Gibraltar, and a Jewish girl. Marion was a
concert singer given to coprophilly, especially in her involutional
stages, spiritual and physical. Bloom's acquired perversion he
attempted to conceal by canvassing for advertisements for _The
Freeman_.

Dublin is the scene of action. The events--those that can be
mentioned--and their sequence are:

    “The preparation for breakfast, intestinal congestion, the
    bath, the funeral, the advertisement of Alexander Keyes, the
    unsubstantial lunch, the visit to Museum and National Library,
    the book-hunt along Bedford Row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington
    Quay, the music in the Ormond Hotel, the altercation with a
    truculent troglodyte, in Bernard Kierman's premises, a blank
    period of time including a car-drive, a visit to a house
    of mourning, a leave-taking, ... the prolonged delivery of
    Mrs. Nina Purefoy, the visit to a disorderly house ... and
    subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver Street, nocturnal
    perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge.”

And these are some of the things they thought and talked of:

    “Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
    prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of
    arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic
    trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman
    catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation,
    Jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day,
    the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.”

Mr. Joyce is an alert, keen-witted, educated man who has made it a
life-long habit to jot down every thought that he has had, drunk or
sober, depressed or exalted, despairing or hopeful, hungry or satiated,
in brothel or in sanctuary, and likewise to put down what he has
seen or heard others do or say--and rhythm has from infancy been an
enchantment of the heart. It is not unlikely that every thought he
has had, every experience he has ever encountered, every person he
has ever met, one might say everything he has ever read in sacred or
profane literature, is to be encountered in the obscurities and in
the franknesses of “Ulysses.” If personality is the sum total of all
one's experiences, all one's thoughts and emotions, inhibitions and
liberations, acquisitions and inheritances, then it may truthfully be
said that “Ulysses” comes nearer to being the perfect revelation of a
personality than any book I know.

He sets down every thought that comes into consciousness. Decency,
propriety, pertinency are not considered. He does not seek to give
them orderliness, sequence, or conclusiveness. His literary output
would seem to substantiate some of Freud's contentions. The majority
of writers, practically all, transfer their conscious, deliberate
thought to paper. Mr. Joyce transfers the product of his unconscious
mind to paper without submitting it to the conscious mind, or if he
submits it, it is to receive approval and encouragement, perhaps even
praise. He holds with Freud that the unconscious mind represents the
real man, the man of Nature, and the conscious mind the artificed man,
the man of convention, of expediency, the slave of Mrs. Grundy, the
sycophant of the Church, the plastic puppet of Society and State. For
him the movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of
the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the hillside. “Peasant's
heart” psychologically is the unconscious mind. When a master
technician of words and phrases set himself the task of revealing the
product of the unconscious mind of a moral monster, a pervert and an
invert, an apostate to his race and his religion, the simulacrum of a
man who has neither cultural background nor personal self-respect, who
can neither be taught by experience nor lessoned by example, as Mr.
Joyce did in drawing the picture of Leopold Bloom, he undoubtedly knew
full well what he was undertaking, how unacceptable the vile contents
of that unconscious mind would be to ninety-nine out of a hundred
readers, and how incensed they would be at having the disgusting
product thrown in their faces. But that has nothing to do with the
question: has the job been done well; is it a work of art? The answer
is in the affirmative.

The proceedings of the council of the gods, with which the book opens,
are tame. Stephen Dædalus, the Telemachus of this Odyssey, is seen
chafing beneath his sin--refusal to kneel down at the bedside of his
dying mother and pray for her--while having an _al fresco_ breakfast in
a semi-abandoned turret with his friend Buck Mulligan (now an esteemed
physician of Dublin), and a ponderous Saxon from Oxford whose father
“made his tin by selling jalap to the Zulus,” who applauds Stephen's
sarcasms and witticisms. Stephen has a grouch because Buck Mulligan has
referred to him, “O, it's only Dædalus whose mother is beastly dead.”
This Stephen construes to be an offense to him, not to his mother.
Persecutory ideas are dear to Stephen Dædalus. In his moody brooding
this is how he welds words:

    “Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from
    the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out
    the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying
    feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining stresses, two
    by two. A hand plucking the harp-strings merging their twining
    chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.”

Meanwhile his sin pursues him as “the Russian gentleman of a particular
kind” pursued Ivan Karamazov when delirium began to overtake him. He
recalls his mother, her secrets, her illness, her last appeals. While
breakfasting Buck and Stephen plan a glorious drunk to astonish the
druidy druids, with the latter's wage of schoolmaster which he will
receive that day. Later Buck goes in the sea while Stephen animadverts
on Ireland's two masters, the Pope of Rome and the King of England, and
recites blasphemous poetry.

Stephen spends the forenoon in school, then takes leave of the pedantic
proprietor, who gives him his salary and a paper on foot and mouth
disease. Telemachus embarks on his voyage, and the goddess who sails
with him communes with him as follows:

    “Ineluctable modality of the visible; at least that if no more,
    thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here
    to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty
    boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of
    the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them
    bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce
    against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire,
    _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in?
    Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through
    it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.”

This is the first specimen of the saltatory, flitting, fugitive,
on-the-surface purposeless thought that Stephen produces as he walks
Sandymount Strand. From this point the book teems with it and with
Bloom's autistic thoughts. It is quite impossible to give a synopsis or
summary of them. It must suffice to say that in the fifteen pages Mr.
Joyce devotes to the first leg of the voyage that will give him news
of Ulysses, an hour's duration, a film picture has been thrown on the
screen of his visual cortex for which he writes legends as fast as the
machine reels them off. It is Mr. Joyce's life that is thus remembered:
his thoughts, ambitions, aspirations, failures, and disappointments;
the record of his contacts and their engenderment--what was and what
might have been. On casual examination, such record transformed into
print looks like gibberish, and is meaningless. So does shorthand. It
is full of meaning for anyone who knows how to read it.

The next fifty pages are devoted to displaying the reel of Mr. Leopold
Bloom's mind, the workings of his psycho-physical machinery, autonomic
and heteronomic, the idle and purposeful thoughts of the most obnoxious
wretch of all mankind, as Eolus called the real Ulysses. While he
forages for his wife's breakfast, prepares and serves it, his thoughts
and reflections are answers to the question “Digman, how camest thou
into the realms of darkness?” for no burial honours yet had Irish
Elpenor received.

Then follows a picture of Dublin before the revolution, its newspapers,
and the men who made them, with comment and characterisation by Stephen
Dædalus, interpolations and solicitations by Leopold Bloom. Naturally
the reader who knew or knew of William Brayden, Esquire, of Oakland,
Sandymount, Mr. J. J. Smolley whose speech reminds of Edmund Burke's
writings, or Mr. Myles Crawford whose witticisms are founded on Pietro
Aretino, would find this chapter more illuminating, though not more
entertaining, than one who had heard of Dublin for the first time in
1914. Nor does it facilitate understanding of the conversation there to
know the geography of an isle afloat where lived the son of Hippotas,
his six daughters, and six blooming sons.

Bloom continues his apparently purposeless and obviously purposeful
thoughts after the Irish Læstrygonians had stoned him, for another
fifty pages. Everything he sees and everyone he encounters generate
them. They are connected, yet they are disparate. I choose one of the
simplest and easiest to quote:

    “A procession of whitesmocked men marched slowly towards him
    along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains.
    Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned, we have
    suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white
    hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a
    chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his
    mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a
    day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep
    skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl:
    no: M'Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I
    suggested to him about a transparent show cart with two smart
    girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes,
    blotting paper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls
    writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know
    what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare
    at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity.
    Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't
    think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with
    a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like
    Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.
    You can't like 'em. What? Our envelops. Hello! Jones, where are
    you going? Can't stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase
    the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell_, sold by Hely's Ltd.,
    85 Dame Street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it
    was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent.
    That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her
    small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love
    by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.
    I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to
    communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said,
    Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She
    knew, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she
    would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money.
    Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for
    them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering
    themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister?
    Pat Claffey, the pawn-broker's daughter. It was a nun they say
    invented barbed wire.”

Man may not think like this, but it is up to the psychologist to prove
it. So far as I know he does. Lunatics do, in manic “flights”; and
flights of ideas are but accentuations of normal mental activity.

The following is a specimen of what psychologists call “flight of
ideas.” To the uninitiated reader it means nothing. To the initiated it
is like the writing on the wall.

    “Bloom. Flood of warm jimjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow
    in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow, invading. Tipping
    her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate
    dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er
    sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joy-gush, tupthrop.
    Now! Language of love.”

In the next section Stephen holds forth on ideals and literature and
gives the world that which Mr. Joyce gave his fellow students in
Dublin to satiety, viz. his views of Shakespeare, and particularly his
conception of Hamlet. “Shakespeare is the happy hunting ground of all
minds that have lost their balance,” one of his cronies remarked. Even
in those days Mr. Joyce's ideas of grandeur suggested to a student
of psychiatry who heard him talk that he had the mental disease with
which that symptom is most constantly associated, and to another of his
auditors that he had an _idée fixe_, and that “the moral idea seems
lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.” They never hurt Mr.
Joyce--such views as these. The armour of his _amour propre_ has never
been pierced; the belief in his destiny has never wavered. The meeting
in the National Library twenty years ago gives him opportunity to
display philosophic erudition, dialectic skill, and artistic feeling in
his talk with the young men and their elders. It would be interesting
to know from any of them, or from Mr. T. S. Eliot, if the following is
the sort of grist that is brought to the free-verse miller, and can
poetry be made from it.

    “Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali
    book we tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot
    he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their
    oversoul, mahamahatma. The faithful hermetists await the light,
    ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T.
    Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies tend them i' the eyes, their
    pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god he thrones, Buddh under
    plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. He souls, she souls, shoals
    of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling,
    they bewail.”

In contrast with this take the following description of the drowned man
in Dublin Bay as a specimen of masterly realism:

    “Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At
    one he said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin Bar. Driving
    before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly
    shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing
    landward, a pace a pace a porpoise. There he is. Hook it quick.
    Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. We have him. Easy
    now. Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.... Dead breaths
    I living breathe, tread dead dust.... Hauled stark over the
    gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his
    leprous nosehole snorting to the sun.”

There are so many “specimens” of writing in the volume that it is quite
impossible to give examples of them. Frankness compels me to state that
he goes out of his way to scoff at God and to besmirch convention, but
that's to show he is not afraid, like the man who defied God to kill
him at 9.48 p.m.

    “The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it
    badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the
    lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call
    _bio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us,
    ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that
    in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more
    marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife
    unto himself.”

The Dædalus family and their neighbourhood--their pawn-brokers,
shopkeepers, spiritual advisers; the people they despised, those they
envied, the Viceroy of Ireland, now come in for consideration. Mr.
Dædalus is a sweet-tempered, mealy-mouthed man given to strong drink
and high-grade vagrancy who calls his daughters “an insolent pack of
little bitches since your poor mother died.” Their appearances and
emotional reactions, and their contacts with Stephen and Bloom who are
passing the time till they shall begin the orgy which is the high-water
mark of the book, are instructive to the student of behaviouristic
psychology.

Readers of Dostoievsky rarely fail to note the fact that occurrences
of a few hours required hundreds of pages to narrate. The element
of time seems to have been eliminated. It is the same in “Ulysses.”
This enormous volume of seven hundred and thirty-two pages is taken
up with thoughts of two men during twelve hours of sobriety and six
of drunkenness. I do not know the population of Dublin, but whatever
it may be, a vast number of these people come into the ken of Dædalus
and Bloom during those hours, and into the readers'; for it is through
their eyes and their ears that we see and hear what transpires and is
said. And so the trusting reader accompanies one or both of them to the
beach, and observes them in revery and in repose; or to a café concert,
and observes them in ructions and in ruminations. A countryman of Mr.
Joyce, Edmund Burke, said “custom reconciles us to everything,” and
after we have accompanied these earthly twins, Stephen and Leopold,
thus far, we do not baulk at the lying-in hospital or even the red
light district, though others more sensitive and less tolerant than
myself would surely wish they had deserted the “bark-waggons” when the
occupants were invited into the brothel.

The book in reality is a moving picture with picturesque legends, many
profane and more vulgar. For a brief time Mr. Joyce was associated with
the “movies,” and the form in which “Ulysses” was cast may have been
suggested by experiences with the Volta Theatre, as his cinematograph
enterprise was called.

Mr. Joyce learned from St. Thomas Aquinas what Socrates learned from
his mother: how to bring thoughts into the world; and from his boyhood
he had a tenderness for rhythm. It crops out frequently in “Ulysses.”

    “In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy
    Michan. There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep
    the mighty dead as in life they slept, warrior and princes
    of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring
    waters, fishful streams where sport the gunnard, the plaice,
    the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the
    dab, the brill, the flounder, the mixed coarse fish generally
    and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be
    enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east
    the lofty trees wave in different directions their first class
    foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
    planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the
    arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well
    supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of
    the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play
    with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots,
    silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,
    creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And
    heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy,
    the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the
    just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan's land and of
    Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes,
    the sons of kings.”

At other times he seems to echo the sonorous phrasing of some forgotten
master: Pater or Rabelais, or to paraphrase William Morris or Walt
Whitman, or to pilfer from the Reverend William Sunday.

    “The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round
    tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed
    frankeyed red-haired freely freckled shaggybearded widemouthed
    largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded
    hairylegged ruddyfaced, sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to
    shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous
    knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body
    wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
    in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex
    Europeus_). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the
    same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within
    their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged
    her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for
    the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A
    powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from
    the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance
    the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart
    thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the
    lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate
    and tremble.”

The chapter from which these quotations are taken, when the friends
turn into Barney Kiernan's to slake their thirst, shows Mr. Joyce
with loosed tongue--the voluble, witty, philosophic Celt, with an
extraordinary faculty of words. If an expert stenographer had taken
down the ejaculations as they spurted from the mouth of Tom and Jerry,
and the deliberations of Alf and Joe, and the other characters of
impulsive energy and vivid desire, then accurately transcribed them,
interpolating “says” frequently, they would read like this chapter.

Conspicuous amongst Mr. Joyce's possessions is a gift for facile
emotional utterance. The reader feels himself affected by his impulses
and swept along by his eloquence. He is scathingly sarcastic about
Irish cultural and political aspirations; loathsomely lewd about their
morals and habits; merciless in his revelations of their temperamental
possessions and infirmities; and arbitrary and unyielding in his belief
that their degeneration is beyond redemption. Like the buckets on an
endless chain of a dredger, the vials of his wrath are poured time
after time upon England and the British Empire “on which the sun never
rises,” but they are never emptied. Finally he embodies his sentiment
in paraphrase of the Creed.

    “They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell
    upon earth and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived
    of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump
    and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody
    hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into
    haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he
    shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.”

He recounts his country's former days of fame and fortune, but he
doesn't foresee any of the happenings of the past three years.

    “Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here
    today instead of four, our lost tribes? And our potteries and
    textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that
    was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our
    damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
    tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough
    and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquand de Lyon
    and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised
    point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it
    in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants that
    came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed
    by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in
    Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even
    Giraldus Cambrensis, Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver
    from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,
    the Irish hobbies, with King Philip of Spain offering to pay
    customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the
    yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined
    hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won't
    deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all
    die of consumption.”

Nowhere is his note-book more evident than in this chapter.
Krafft-Ebing, a noted Viennese psychiatrist, said a certain disease was
due to civilisation and syphilisation. Mr. Joyce made note of it and
uses it. The _Slocum_ steamboat disaster in New York, which touched all
American hearts twenty years ago; the prurient details of a scandal in
“loop” circles of Chicago; a lynching in the South are referred to as
casually by Lenehan, Wyse _et al_ while consuming their two pints, as
if they were family matters.

That the author has succeeded in cutting and holding up to view a slice
of life in this chapter and in the succeeding one--Bloom amongst the
Nurse-girls--it would be idle to deny. That it is sordid and repulsive
need scarcely be said. It has this in common with the writings of all
the naturalists.

The author's familiarity with the Dadaists is best seen in his chapter
on the visit to the Lying-in Hospital. Some of it is done in the
pseudostyle of the English and Norse Saga; some in the method adopted
by d'Annunzio in his composition of “Nocturne.” He wrote thousands and
thousands of words on small pieces of paper, then threw them into a
basket, and shuffled them thoroughly. With a blank sheet before him and
a dripping mucilage brush in one hand, he proceeded to paste them one
after another on the sheet. A sample of the result is:

    “Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little
    perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as
    most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied
    who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite
    and certainly by reason of that in them high mind's ornament
    deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general
    consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by
    no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more
    efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward
    may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that
    proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be
    absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of
    omnipollent nature's incorrupted benefaction.”

Tired of this, he paraphrases the Holy Writ.

    “And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and
    there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at
    meat. And there came against the place as they stood a young
    learning knight yclept Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was
    couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each
    with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight
    lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed
    for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
    horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did
    do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might
    suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for
    to make merry with them that were there.”

When this palls, he apes a satirist like Rabelais, or a mystic like
Bunyan. Weary of this, he turns to a treatise on embryology and a
volume of obstetrics and strains them through his mind. One day some
serious person, a disciple or a benighted admirer, such as M. Valery
Larbaud, will go through “Ulysses” to find references to toxicology,
Mosaic law, the Kamustra, eugenics, etc., as such persons and scholars
have gone through Shakespeare. Until it is done no one will believe the
number of subjects he touches is marvellous, and sometimes even the way
he does it. For instance this on birth control:

    “Murmur, Sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent
    now glorify their Maker, the one limbo gloom, the other in purge
    fire. But, Gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
    nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost,
    Very God, Lord and Giver of Life.”

It is worthy of note also that Mr. Joyce defines specifically the sin
against the Holy Ghost, which for long has been a stumbling block to
priest and physician. He does not agree with the great Scandinavian
writer toward whom he looked reverently in his youth. Ella Rentheim
says to Borkman, “The Bible speaks of a mysterious sin for which there
is no forgiveness. I have never understood what it could be; but now I
understand. The great, unpardonable sin is to murder the love-life in a
human soul.”

The object of it all is to display the thought and erudition of Stephen
Dædalus, “a sensitive nature, smarting under the lashes of an undivined
and squalid way of life”; and the emotions, perversions, and ambitions
of Leopold Bloom, a devotee of applied science, whose inventions were
for the purpose of

    “rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of
    hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes,
    exhibiting the twelve constellations of the Zodiac from Aries
    to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine
    lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits,
    globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.”

It is particularly in the next chapter, one of the strangest of
literature, that Mr. Joyce displays the apogee of his art. Dædalus
and Bloom have passed in review on a mystic stage all their intimates
and enemies, all their detractors and sycophants, the scum of Dublin,
and the spawn of the devil. Mr. Joyce resurrects Saint Walpurgis,
galvanises her into life after twelve centuries' death intimacy with
Beelzebub, and substituting a squalid section of Dublin for Brocken,
proceeds to depict a festival, the devil being host. The guests in the
flesh and of the spirit have still many of their distinctive corporeal
possessions, but the reactions of life no longer exist. The chapter is
replete with wit, humour, satire, philosophy, learning, knowledge of
human frailties, and human indulgences, especially with the brakes of
morality off. And alcohol or congenital deficiency takes them off for
most of the characters. It reeks of lust and filth, but Mr. Joyce says
life does, and the morality he depicts is the only one he knows.

In this chapter is compressed all of the author's experiences, all his
determinations and unyieldingness, and most of the incidents that gave
a persecutory twist to his mind, made him an exile from his native
land, and deprived him of the courage to return. He does not hesitate
to bring in the ghost of his mother whom he had been accused of killing
because he would not kneel down and pray for her when she was dying,
and to question her as to the verity of the accusation. But he does
not repent even when she returns from the spiritual world. In fact,
the capacity for repentance is left out of Mr. Joyce's make-up. It is
as impossible to convince Mr. Joyce that he is wrong about anything
on which he has made up his mind as it is to convince a paranoiac
of the unreality of his false beliefs, or a jealous woman of the
groundlessness of her suspicions. It may be said that this chapter
does not represent life, but I venture to say that it represents life
with photographic accuracy as Mr. Joyce has seen it and lived it;
that every scene has come within his gaze; that every speech has been
heard or said; and every sentiment experienced or thrust upon him. It
is a mirror held up to life--life which we could sincerely wish and
devoutly pray that we were spared; for it is life in which happiness is
impossible, save when forgetfulness of its existence is brought about
by alcohol, and in which mankind is destitute of virtue, deprived of
ideals, deserted by love.

To disclaim it is life that countless men and women know would be
untrue, absurd, and libellous. I do not know that Mr. Joyce makes any
such claim, but I claim that it is life that he has known.

Mr. Joyce had the good fortune to be born with a quality which the
world calls genius. Nature exacts a galling income tax from genius,
and as a rule she co-endows it with unamenability to law and order.
Genius and reverence are antipodal, Galileo being the exception to
the rule. Mr. Joyce has no reverence for organised religion, for
conventional morality, for literary style or form. He has no conception
of the word obedience, and he bends the knee neither to God nor man.
It is interesting and important to have the revelations of such a
personality, to have them first hand and not dressed up. Heretofore our
only avenues of information concerning them led through asylums for the
insane, for it was there that revelations were made without reserve. I
have spent much time and money in my endeavour to get such revelations,
without great success. Mr. Joyce has made it unnecessary for me to
pursue the quest. He has supplied the little and big pieces of material
from which the mental mosaic is made.

He had the profound misfortune to lose his faith, and he cannot rid
himself of the obsession that the Jesuits did it for him. He is trying
to get square by saying disagreeable things about them and holding
their teachings up to scorn and obloquy. He was so unfortunate as to be
born without a sense of duty, of service, of conformity to the State,
to the community, to society; and he is convinced he should tell about
it, just as some who have experienced a surgical operation feel that
they must relate minutely all its details, particularly at dinner
parties and to casual acquaintances.

Not ten men or women out of a hundred can read “Ulysses” through,
and of the ten who succeed in doing it for five of them it will be a
_tour de force_. I am probably the only person aside from the author
that has ever read it twice from beginning to end. I read it as a test
of Christian fortitude: to see if I could still love my fellow-man
after reading a book that depicts such repugnance of humanity, such
abhorence of the human body, and such loathsomeness of the possession
that links man with God, the creative endowment. Also the author is
a psychologist, and I find his empiric knowledge supplements mine
acquired by prolonged and sustained effort.

M. Valery Larbaud, a French critic who hailed “Ulysses” with the
reverence with which Boccaccio hailed the Divine Comedy, and who has
been giving conferences on “Ulysses” in Paris, says the key to the
book is Homer's immortal poem. If M. Larbaud has the key he cannot
spring the lock of the door of the dark safe in which “Ulysses” rests,
metaphorically, for most readers. At least he has not done so up to
this writing.

The key is to be found in the antepenultimate chapter of the book; and
it isn't a key, it's a combination, a countryman of Mr. Joyce's might
say. Anyone who tries at it long enough will succeed in working it,
even if he is not of M. Larbaud's cultivated readers who can fully
appreciate such authors as Rabelais, Montaigne, and Descartes.

The symbolism of the book is something that concerns only Mr. Joyce,
as nuns do, and other animate and inanimate things of which he has
fugitive thoughts and systematised beliefs.

After the Cheu-sinese orgy, Bloom takes Stephen home, and
unfortunately they awaken Marion, for she embraces the occasion to
purge her mind in soliloquy. Odo of Cluny never said anything of a
woman's body in life that is so repulsive as that which Mr. Joyce has
said of Marion's mind: a cesspool of forty years' accumulation. Into it
has drained the inherited vulgarities of Jew and gentile parent; within
it has accumulated the increment of a sordid, dissolute life in two
countries, extending over twenty-five years; in it have been compressed
the putrid exhalations of studied devotion to sense gratification.
Mr. Joyce takes off the lid and opens the sluice-way simultaneously,
and the result is that the reader, even though his sensitisation has
been fortified by reading the book, is bowled over. As soon as he
regains equilibrium he communes with himself to the effect that if the
world has many Marions missionaries should be withdrawn from heathen
countries and turned into this field where their work will be praised
by man and rewarded by God.

Mental hygiene takes on a deeper significance to one who succeeds in
reading “Ulysses,” and psychology has a larger ceinture.

Much time has been wasted in conjecturing what Mr. Joyce's message is.
In another connection he said, “My ancestors threw off their language
and took another. They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them.
Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and person debts they
made? No honourable and sincere man has given up his life, his youth,
and his affections to Ireland from the days of Tone to those of Parnell
but the Irish sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled
him and left him for another. Ireland is the old sow that eats her
farrow.”

“Ulysses” is in part vendetta. He will ridicule Gaelic renaissance of
literature and language; he will traduce the Irish people and vilify
their religion; he will scorn their institutions, lampoon their morals,
pasquinade their customs; he will stun them with obscene vituperation,
wound them with sacrilege and profanity, immerse them in the vitriolic
dripping from the “tank” that he seeks to drive over them; and for what
purpose? Revenge. Those dissatisfied with the simile of the fury of a
scorned woman should try “Ulysses.”

Mr. Joyce has made a contribution to the science of psychology, and he
has done it quite unbeknownst to himself, a fellow-countryman might
say. He has shown us the process of the transmuting of thought to
words. It isn't epoch making like “relativity,” but it will give him
notoriety, possibly immortality.

                              CHAPTER III
       FEODOR DOSTOIEVSKY: TRAGEDIST, PROPHET, AND PSYCHOLOGIST


A hundred years ago, in Moscow, a being manifested its existence, who
in the fullness of extraordinary vision and intellectuality heralded
a religious rebirth, became the prophet of a new moral, ethical, and
geographical order in the world, and the prototype of a new hero. Time
has accorded Feodor Mikhailovitch Dostoievsky the position of one of
the greatest writers of the nineteenth century, and as time passes his
position becomes more secure. Like the prophet of old, during life he
was fastened between two pieces of timber--debts and epilepsy--and sawn
asunder by his creditors and his conscience. Posterity links his name
with Pushkin and Tolstoi as the three great writers of their times.
They are to the Russian Renaissance what Leonardo, Michelangelo, and
Raphael were to the Italian Renaissance.

It is appropriate now, the centenary of his birth, to make a brief
statement of Dostoievsky's position as a writer or novelist, and
in so doing estimate must be made of him as a prophet, preacher,
psychologist, pathologist, artist, and individual. Though he was not
schooled to speak as expert in any of these fields, yet speak in them
he did, and in a way that would have reflected credit upon a professor.
It is particularly the field of morbid psychology, usually called
psychiatry, that Dostoievsky made uniquely his own. He described many
of the nervous and mental disorders, such as mania and depression, the
psychoneuroses, hysteria, obsessive states, epilepsy, moral insanity,
alcoholism, and that mysterious mental and moral constitution called
“degeneracy” (apparently first hand, for there is no evidence or
indication that he had access to books on mental medicine), in such a
way that alienists recognise in his descriptions masterpieces in the
same way that the painter recognises the apogee of his art in Giotto or
Velázquez.

Not only did he portray the mental activity and output of the
partially and potentially insane, but he described the conduct and
reproduced the speech of individuals with personality defects, and
with emotional disequilibrium, in a way that has never been excelled
in any literature. For instance, it would be difficult to find a more
comprehensive account of adult infantilism than the history of Stepan
Trofimovitch, a more accurate presentation of the composition of a
hypocrite than Rahkitin, of “The Brothers Karamazov.” No one save
Shakespeare has shown how consuming and overwhelming jealousy may be.
That infirmity has a deeper significance for anyone familiar with the
story of Katerina Ivanovna. Indeed Dostoievsky is the novelist of
passions. He creates his creatures that they may suffer, not that they
may enjoy from the reactions of life, though some of them get pleasure
in suffering. Such was Lise, the true hysteric, who said, “I should
like some one to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me
and then go away. I don't want to be happy.”

[Illustration: FEODOR DOSTOIEVSKY]

Like Baudelaire and Nietzsche, whom he resembled morally and
intellectually, Dostoievsky was an intellectual romantic in rebellion
against life. His determination seemed to be to create an individual
who should defy life, and when he had defied it to his heart's content
“to hand God back his ticket,” having no further need of it as the
journey of existence was at an end. There is no place to go, nothing
to do, everything worth trying has been tried and found valueless, and
wherever he turns his gaze he sees the angel standing upon the sea
and upon the earth avowing that there shall be time no longer; so he
puts a bullet in his temple if his name is Svidrigailov, or soaps a
silken cord so that it will support his weight when one end is attached
to a large nail and the other to his neck, if it is Stavrogin.
Dostoievsky as a littérateur was obsessed with sin and expiation.
He connived and laboured to invent some new sin; he struggled and
fought to augment some old one with which he could inflict one of his
creation, and then watch him contend with it, stagger beneath it, or
flaunt it in the world's face. After it has wrought havoc, shipwrecked
the possessor's life, and brought inestimable calamity and suffering
to others, then he must devise adequate expiation. Expiation is
synonymous with sincere regret, honest request for forgiveness, and
genuine determination to sin no more, but Dostoievsky's sinners must
do something more; they must make renunciation in keeping with the
magnitude of their sins, and as this is beyond human expression they
usually kill themselves or go mad.

He had planned for his masterpiece “The Life of a Great Sinner,” and
the outline of it from his note-book deposited in the Central Archive
Department of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, has
now been published. The hero is a composite of the Seven Deadly Sins:
pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth, plus the
sin against the Holy Ghost. No one has yet succeeded in defining that
sin satisfactorily, but it is what Dostoievsky's antinomian heroes were
trying to do, especially such an one as Stavrogin. Another noteworthy
feature about them is that they were all sadistic or masochistic: they
got pleasure varying from an appreciative glow to voluptuous ecstasy
and beyond, from causing pain and inducing humiliation, or having it
caused in them by others.

This was a conditioning factor of conduct of all his antinomian heroes,
and unless it be kept in mind when reading of them, their antics and
their reflections are sometimes difficult of comprehension. He makes
one of them, one of the most intellectual and moral, Ivan Karamazov,
say “You know we prefer beating-rods and scourges--that's our national
institution.... I know for a fact there are people who at every blow
are worked up to sensuality, which increases progressively at every
blow they inflict.”

It is difficult for a psychiatrist, after reading Dostoievsky's novels,
to believe that he did not have access to the literature of insanity
or have first-hand knowledge of the insane, and the criminologist must
wonder where he got his extraordinary knowledge of the relation between
suffering and lust. It may be that the habits of the Emperor Cheou-sin
Yeow-waug were known to him, just as those of Caligula and Claudius
were known to him.

It is not with the passions of the body or of the senses alone that
his heroes contend, but with those of the mind. The fire that burns
within them is abstraction, and the fuel that replenishes it is
thought--thought of whence and whither. By it the possessors are lashed
to a conduct that surpasses that of hate, jealousy, lubricity, or any
of the baser passions as the light of an incandescent bulb surpasses
that of a tallow candle. They are all men of parts, either originally
endowed with great intelligence or brought to a certain elevation of
intellectuality by education. Their conduct, their actions, their
misdeeds, their crimes are the direct result of their argumentation,
not of concrete, but of abstract things, and chiefly the nature and
existence of God, the varieties of use that an individual may permit
his intelligence, free-will, free determination, and of the impositions
of dogma founded on faith and inspiration which seem contrary to reason
and science.

All his heroes are more or less insane. Herein lies Dostoievsky's
strength and his weakness in character creation. None of them could
be held fully responsible in a court of justice. Out of the mouth
of babes and sucklings the Lord ordained strength, but there is no
writing to show that out of the mouths of the insane comes wisdom. Not
that insanity is inimical to brilliant, even wise, utterance; but the
pragmatic application of wisdom to life calls for sanity.

Dostoievsky himself was abnormal. He was what the physician calls a
neuropathic and psychopathic individual. In addition, he had genuine
epilepsy, that is, epilepsy not dependent upon some accidental disease,
such as infection, injury, or new growth. He was of psychopathic
temperament and at different times in his life displayed hallucination,
obsession, and hypochondria.

He wrote of them as if he were the professor, not the possessor. The
psychopathic constitution displays itself as:

    “An unstable balance of the psychic impulses, an overfacile
    tendency to emotion, an overswift interchange of mental phases,
    an abnormally violent reaction of the psychic mechanism. The
    feature most striking to the beholder in the character of such
    sufferers is its heterogeneous medley of moods and whims, of
    sympathies and antipathies; of ideas in turn joyous, stern,
    gloomy, depressed and philosophical; of aspirations at first
    charged with energy then dying away to nothing. Another feature
    peculiar to these sufferers is their self-love. They are the
    most naïve of egoists; they talk exclusively and persistently
    and absorbedly of themselves; they strive always to attract the
    general attention, to excite the general interest and to engage
    everyone in conversation concerning their personality, their
    ailments and even their vices.”

Scores of his characters had such constitution, and in none is it more
perfectly delineated than in Katerina Ivanovna, though Lise Hohlakov,
of the same novel, had wider display of the hysteria that grew on this
fertile soil.

The facts of Dostoievsky's life that are important to the reader who
would comprehend his psychopathic creations are that his father,
surgeon to the Workhouse Hospital at Moscow, was a stern, suspicious,
narrow-minded, gloomy, distrustful man who made a failure of life. “He
has lived in the world fifty years and yet he has the same opinions
of mankind that he had thirty years ago,” wrote Feodor when seventeen
years old. His mother was tender-minded, pious, and domestic, and died
early of tuberculosis. Although much has been written of his boyhood,
there is nothing particularly interesting in it bearing on his career
save that he was sensitive, introspective, unsociable, and early
displayed a desire to be alone. The hero of the book “Youth” relates
that in the lowest classes of the gymnasium he scorned all relations
with those of his class who surpassed him in any way in the sciences,
physical strength, or in clever repartee. He did not hate such a person
nor wish him harm. He simply turned away from him, that being his
nature. These characteristics run like a red thread through the entire
life of Dostoievsky. A tendency to day-dreaming was apparent in his
earliest years, and he gives graphic accounts of hallucination in “An
Author's Diary.” At the age of sixteen he was admitted to the School of
Engineering and remained there six years. During the latter part of his
student days he decided upon literature as a career. Before taking it
up, however, he had a brief experience with life after he had obtained
his commission as engineer, which showed him to be totally incapable
of dealing with its every-day eventualities, particularly in relation
to money, whose purpose he knew but whose value was ever to remain a
secret. It was then that he first displayed inability to subscribe or
to submit to ordinary social conventions; indeed, a determination to
transgress them.

From his earliest years the misfortunes of others hurt him and
distressed him, and in later life the despised and the rejected, the
poor and the oppressed, always had his sympathy and his understanding.
God and the people, that is the Russian people, were his passion. “The
people have a lofty instinct for truth. They may be dirty, degraded,
repellent, but without them and in disregard of them nothing useful
can be effected.” The intellectuals who held themselves aloof from
the masses he could not abide, and atheists, and their propaganda
socialism, were anathema. He demanded of men who arrogated to
themselves a distinction above their fellow men, “who go to the people
not to learn to know it, but condescendingly to instruct and patronise
it,” not only repentance, but expiation by suffering.

His first important literary contribution was entitled “Poor Folk.”
He was fortunate enough to be praised by his contemporaries and
particularly by Bielinsky, an editor and great critic, who saw in
the central idea of the story corroboration of his favourite theory,
viz.: abnormal social conditions distort and dehumanise mankind to
such an extent that they lose the human form and semblance. As the
result of this publication, Dostoievsky made the acquaintance of the
leading literary lights of St. Petersburg, many of whom praised him too
immoderately for his own good, as he produced nothing worthy of his
fame until many years after the event in his life which must be looked
upon as the beginning of his mental awakenment--banishment and penal
servitude in Siberia.

Toward the middle of the nineteenth century the doctrines of the
Frenchman, Charles Fourier, were having such acceptance in this
country, where the North American Phalanx in New Jersey and the
Brook farm in Massachusetts were thriving, as to encourage the
disciples of that sentimental but wholly mad socialist in other lands,
particularly in Russia, that their hopes of seeing the world dotted
with _Phalansteres_ might be fulfilled. Dostoievsky later stated most
emphatically that he never believed in Fourierism, but nibbling at it
nearly cost him his life. In fact, all that stood between him and death
was the utterance of the word “Go,” which it would seem the lips of the
executioner had puckered to utter when the reprieve came. Dostoievsky
was suspected of being a Revolutionary. One evening at the Petrashevsky
Club he declaimed Pushkin's poem on Solitude:

  “My friends, I see the people no longer oppressed,
  And slavery fallen by the will of the Czar,
  And a dawn breaking over us, glorious and bright,
  And our country lighted by freedom's rays.”

In discussion he suggested that the emancipation of the peasantry might
have to come through a rising. Thus he became suspected. But it was not
until he denounced the censorship and reflected on its severity and
injustice that he was taken into custody. He and twenty-one others were
sentenced to death. He spent four years in a Siberian prison and there
became acquainted with misery, suffering, and criminality that beggars
description.

    “What a number of national types and characters I became
    familiar with in the prison; I lived into their lives and so
    I believe I know them really well. Many tramps' and thieves'
    careers were laid bare to me, and above all the whole wretched
    existence of the common people. I learnt to know the Russian
    people as only a few know them.”

After four years he was, through the mediation of powerful friends,
transferred for five years to military service in Siberia, chiefly at
Semipalatinsk. In 1859 he was permitted to return to St. Petersburg,
and in the twenty years that followed he published those books upon
which his fame rests; namely, “Crime and Punishment,” “The Idiot,” “The
Possessed,” “The Journal of an Author,” and “The Brothers Karamazov.”
In 1867 he was obliged to leave Russia to escape imprisonment for debt,
and he remained abroad, chiefly in Switzerland, for four years.

In his appeal to General Todleben to get transferred from the military
to the civil service and to be permitted to employ himself in
literature, he said:

    “Perhaps you have heard something of my arrest, my trial and
    the supreme ratification of the sentence which was given in the
    case concerning me in the year 1849. I was guilty and am very
    conscious of it. I was convicted of the intention (but only the
    intention) of acting against the Government; I was lawfully
    and quite justly condemned; the hard and painful experiences
    of the ensuing years have sobered me and altered my views in
    many respects, but then while I was still blind I believed in
    all the theories and Utopias. For two years before my offense
    I had suffered from a strange moral disease--I had fallen into
    hypochondria. There was a time even when I lost my reason. I was
    exaggeratedly irritable, had a morbidly developed sensibility
    and the power of distorting the most ordinary events into things
    immeasurable.”

While Dostoievsky was in prison his physical health improved very
strikingly, but, despite this, his epilepsy, which had previously
manifested itself only in vague or minor attacks, became fully
developed. Attempts have been made to prove that prison life and
particularly its hardships and inhumanities were responsible in a
measure for Dostoievsky's epilepsy; but such allegations are no more
acceptable than those which attribute it to his father's alcoholism.
His epilepsy was a part of his general make-up, a part of his
constitution. It was an integral part of him and it became an integral
part of his books.

The phenomena of epilepsy may be said to be the epileptic personality
and the attack with its warning, its manifestations, and the
after-effects. The disease is veiled in the same mystery today as it
was when Hercules was alleged to have had it. Nothing is known of its
causation or of its dependency, and all that can truthfully be said
of the personality of the epileptic is that it is likely to display
psychic disorder, evanescent or fixed. Attacks are subject to the
widest variation both as to frequency and intensity, but the most
enigmatic things about the disease are the warnings of the attack, and
the phenomena that sometimes appear vicariously of the attack--the
epileptic equivalent they are called. Dostoievsky had these _auræ_ and
equivalents in an unusual way and with extraordinary intensity, and
narration of them as they were displayed in the different characters
of his creation who were afflicted with epilepsy, and of their effects
and consequences is an important part of every one of his great books.
Dostoievsky would seem to have been of the belief that a brain in
which some of the mechanisms are disordered may yet remain superior
both intellectually and morally to others less affected, and that
the display of such weakness or maladjustment may put the possessor
in tune with the Infinite, may permit him to blend momentarily with
the Eternal Harmony, to be restored temporarily to the Source of its
temporal emanation. Although he describes this in his “Letters,” as he
experienced it, he elaborates it in his epileptic heroes, and in none
so seductively as in “The Idiot.” He makes Prince Myshkin say:

    “He thought amongst other things how in his epileptic
    condition there was one stage, just before the actual attack,
    when suddenly in the midst of sadness, mental darkness and
    oppression his brain flared up, as it were, and with an unwonted
    outburst all his vital powers were vivified simultaneously. The
    sensation of living and of self-consciousness was increased at
    such moments almost tenfold. They were moments like prolonged
    lightning. As he thought over this afterward in a normal state
    he often said to himself that all these flashes and beams of
    the highest self-realisation, self-consciousness and “highest
    existence” were nothing but disease, the interruption of the
    normal state. If this were so, then it was by no means the
    highest state, but, on the contrary, it must be reckoned as the
    very lowest. And yet he came at last to the very paradoxical
    conclusion: What matter if it is a morbid state? What difference
    can it make that the tension is abnormal, if the result itself,
    if the moment of sensation when remembered and examined in the
    healthy state proves to be in the highest degree harmony and
    beauty, and gives an unheard-of and undreamed-of feeling of
    completion, of balance, of satisfaction and exultant prayerful
    fusion with the highest synthesis of life? If at the last moment
    of consciousness before the attack he had happened to say to
    himself lucidly and deliberately “for this one moment one might
    give one's whole life,” then certainly that moment would be
    worth a lifetime. However, he did not stand out for dialectics;
    obfuscation, mental darkness and idiocy stand before him as the
    obvious consequences of those loftiest moments.”

It is a question for the individual to decide whether one would give
his whole life for a moment of perfection and bliss, but it is probable
that no one would without assurance that some permanent advantage, some
growth of spirit that could be retained, some impress of spirituality
that was indelible, such as comes from an understanding reading of
“Hamlet” or a comprehended rendering of “Parsifal,” would flow from
it or follow it. But to have it and then come back to a world that
is “just one damn thing after another” it is impossible to believe.
Dostoievsky was right when he said that Myshkin could look forward
to obfuscation, mental darkness, and imbecility with some certainty,
for physicians experienced with epilepsy know empirically that the
unfortunates who have panoplied warnings, and especially illusions,
are most liable to become demented early. But that all epileptics with
such warnings do not suffer this degradation is attested by the life of
Dostoievsky, who was in his mental summation when death seized him in
his sixtieth year.

Another phenomenon of epilepsy that Dostoievsky makes many of his
characters display is detachment of the spirit from the body. They
cease to feel their bodies at supreme moments, such as at the
moment of condemnation, of premeditated murder, or planned crime.
In other words, they are thrown into a state of ecstasy similar to
that responsible for the mystic utterances of St. Theresa, or of
insensibility to obvious agonies such as that of Santa Fina. He not
only depicts the phenomena of the epileptic attack, its warnings, and
its after-effects in the most masterful way, as they have never been
rendered in literature, lay or scientific, but he also describes many
varieties of the disease. Before he was exiled, in 1847, he gave a most
perfect description of the epileptic constitution as it was manifested
in Murin, a character in “The Landlady.” The disease, as it displays
itself in the classical way, is revealed by Nelly in “The Insulted and
Injured,” but it is in Myshkin, in “The Idiot,” that we see epilepsy
transforming the individual from adult infantilism, gradually, almost
imperceptibly, to imbecility, the victim meantime displaying nobility
and tender-mindedness that make the reader's heart go out to him.

The first fruits of Dostoievsky's activities after he had obtained
permission to publish were inconsequential. It was not until the
appearance of “Letters from a Deadhouse,” which revealed his
experiences and thoughts while in prison, and the volume called “The
Despised and the Rejected,” that the literary world of St. Petersburg
realised that the brilliant promise which he had given in 1846 was
realised. Some of his literary adventures, especially in journalism,
got him into financial difficulties, and he began to write under the
lash, as he described it, and against time.

In 1865 appeared the novel by which he is widely known, “Crime and
Punishment,” in which Dostoievsky's first great antinomian hero,
Raskolnikov, a repentant nihilist, is introduced to the reader.
He believes that he has a special right to live, to rebel against
society, to transgress every law and moral precept, and to follow
the dictates of his own will and the lead of his own thought. Such
a proud, arrogant, intellectual spirit requires to be cleansed,
and inasmuch as the verity, the essence of life, lies in humility,
Dostoievsky makes his hero murder an old pawnbroker and his sister and
then proceeds to put him through the most excruciating mental agony
imaginable. At the same time his mother and sister undergo profound
vicarious suffering, while a successor of Mary Magdalene succours
him in his increasingly agonised state and finally accompanies him
to penal servitude. Many times Raskolnikov appears upon the point of
confessing his crime from the torments of his own conscience, but, in
reality, Svidrigailov, a strange monster of sin and sentiment, and the
police officer, Petrovitch, a forerunner of Sherlock Holmes, suggest
the confession to him, and between the effect of their suggestion and
the appeal of Sonia, whose love moves him strangely, he confesses but
does not repent. He does not repent because he has done no sin. He has
committed no crime. The scales have not yet fallen from his eyes. That
is reserved for the days and nights of his prison life and is to be
mediated by Sonia's sacrificial heroism.

It is interesting to contemplate Dostoievsky at the state of
development when he wrote “Crime and Punishment,” or rather the state
of development of his idea of free will. Raskolnikov has the same
relation to Stavrogin of “The Possessed” and to Kirillov, the epileptic
of the same book, as one of the trial pictures of the figures in the
Last Supper has to Leonardo's masterpiece. Dostoievsky apparently was
content to describe a case of moral imbecility in its most attractive
way, and then when he had outlined its lineaments, to leave it and not
adjust it to the other groupings of the picture that was undertaken.
It would seem that his interest had got switched from Raskolnikov to
Svidrigailov, who has dared to outrage covenants and conventions,
laws and morality, and has measured his will against all things.
Svidrigailov knows the difference between good and evil, right and
wrong; indeed he realises it with great keenness, and when he finds
that he is up against it, as it were, and has no escape, he puts the
revolver to his temple and pulls the trigger. Death is the only thing
he has not tried, and why wait to see whether eternity is just one
little room like a bathhouse in the country, or whether it is something
beyond conception? Why not find out at once as everything has been
found out? Svidrigailov is Dostoievsky's symbol of the denial of God,
the denial of a will beyond his own.

    “If there is a will beyond my own, it must be an evil will
    because pain exists. Therefore I must will evil to be in
    harmony with it. If there is no will beyond my own, then I must
    assert my own will until it is free of all check beyond itself.
    Therefore I must will evil.”

Raskolnikov represents the conflict of will with the element of moral
duty and conscience, and Svidrigailov represents its conflict with
defined, deliberate passion. This same will in conflict with the will
of the people, the State, is represented by Stavrogin and Shatov, while
its conflict with metaphysical and religious mystery is represented
by Karamazov, Myshkin, and Kirillov. Despite the fact that they pass
through the furnace of burning conflicts and the fire of inflaming
passions, the force of dominant will is ever supreme. Their human
individuality, as represented by their ego, remains definite and
concrete. It is untouched, unaltered, undissolved. Though they oppose
themselves to the elements that are devouring them, they continue to
assert their ego and self-will even when their end is at hand. Myshkin,
Alyosha, and Zosima submit to God's will but not to man's.

“Crime and Punishment” and “The Brothers Karamazov” are the books by
which Dostoievsky is best known in this country, and the latter, though
unfinished, was intended by him to be his great work, “a work that is
very dear to me for I have put a great deal of my inmost self into
it,” and it has been so estimated by the critics. Indeed, it is the
summary of all his thoughts, of all his doubts, of all his fancies, and
such statement of his faith as he could formulate. It is saturated in
mysticism and it is a _vade mecum_ of psychiatry. It is the narrative
of the life of an egotistic, depraved, sensuous monster, who is a toad,
a cynic, a scoffer, a drunkard, and a profligate, the synthesis of
which, when combined with moral anæsthesia, constitutes degeneracy; of
his three legitimate sons and their mistresses; and of an epileptic
bastard son who resulted from the rape of an idiot girl.

The eldest son, Dimitri, grows up unloved, unguided, unappreciated,
frankly hostile to his father whom he loathes and despises,
particularly when he is convinced that the father has robbed him of his
patrimony. He has had a rake's career, but when Katerina Ivanovna puts
herself unconditionally in his power to save her father's honour he
spares her. Three months later, when betrothed to her, he has become
entangled in Circe's toils by Grushenka, for whose favour Fyodor
Pavlovitch, his father, is bidding.

The second son, Ivan, half brother to Dimitri, whose mother was driven
to insanity by the orgies staged in her own house and by the lusts
and cruelties of her husband, is an intellectual and a nihilist. He
is in rebellion against life, but he has an unquenchable thirst for
life, and he will not accept the world. To love one's neighbours is
impossible; even to conceive of it is repugnant. He will not admit
that all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, and he insists
“while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own measures.” He does
not want forgiveness earned for him vicariously. He wants to do it
himself. He wants to avenge his suffering, to satisfy his indignation,
even if he is wrong. Too high a price is asked for harmony; it is
beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. “And so,” he says to
his younger brother, the potential Saint Alyosha, “I hasten to give
back my entrance ticket. It's not God that I don't accept, only I most
respectfully return Him the ticket.”

Dostoievsky speaks oftener out of the mouth of Ivan than of any of his
other characters. When some understanding Slav like Myereski shall
formulate Dostoievsky's religious beliefs it will likely be found that
they do not differ materially from those of Ivan, as stated in the
chapter “Pro and Contra” of “The Brothers Karamazov.” He sees in Christ
the Salvation of mankind, and the woe of the world is that it has not
accepted Him.

The third brother, Alyosha, is the prototype of the man's redeemer--a
tender-minded, preoccupied youth, chaste and pure, who takes no thought
for the morrow and always turns the other cheek, and esteems his
neighbour far more than himself. At heart he is a sensualist. “All the
Karamazovs are insects to whom God has given sensual lust which will
stir up a tempest in your blood,” said Ivan to Alyosha when he was
attempting to set forth his philosophy of life. But this endowment
permits him the more comprehensively to understand the frailties of
others and to condone their offences. The monastic life appeals to
him, but he is warded off from it by Father Zosima, the prototype of
Bishop Tikhon, in “Stavrogin's Confession,” whose clay was lovingly
moulded by Dostoievsky, but into whose nostrils he did not blow the
breath of life. This monk, who had been worldly and who, because of
his knowledge, forgives readily and wholly, is a favourite figure
of Dostoievsky, and one through whom he frequently expresses his
sentiments and describes his visions. His convictions, conduct and
teaching may be summarised in his own words:

    “Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your
    penitence fail not, God will forgive all. There is no sin, and
    there can be no sin on all the earth, which the Lord will not
    forgive to the truly repentant! Man cannot commit a sin so great
    as to exhaust the infinite love of God. Can there be a sin
    which could exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance,
    continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether. Believe
    that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He loves you
    with your sin, in your sin. It has been said of old that over
    one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten
    righteous men. Go, and fear not. Be not bitter against men.
    Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the dead man in your
    heart what wrong he did you. Be reconciled with him in truth.
    If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God.
    All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I,
    a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on
    you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless treasure
    that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not only
    your own sins but the sins of others.”

Alyosha is Dostoievsky's attempt to create a superman. He is the most
real, the most vital, the most human, and, at the same time, the most
lovable of all his characters. He is the essence of Myshkin and
Stavrogin and Karamazov and Father Zosima, the residue that is left
in the crucible when their struggles were reduced, their virtues and
their vices distilled. He is Myshkin whose mind has not been destroyed
by epilepsy, he is Stavrogin who has seen light before his soul was
sold to the devil, he is Ivan Karamazov redeemed by prayer and good
works, he is the apotheosis of Father Zosima. “He felt clearly and as
it were tangibly that something firm and unshakable as the vault of
heaven had entered into his soul. It was as though some idea had seized
the sovereignty of his mind--and it was for all his life and for ever
and for ever.” In other words, Alyosha realises in a mild form and
continuously that which Myshkin realises as the result of disease and
spasmodically. Alyosha goes into a state of faith, of resignation,
of adjustment with the Infinite, and Myshkin goes into dementia via
ecstasy.

As a peace-maker, adjuster, comforter, and inspiration he has few
superiors in profane literature. His speech at the Stone of Ilusha
embodies the whole doctrine of brotherly love.

Dimitri's hatred of his father becomes intense when they are rivals for
Grushenka's favours, so that it costs him no pang to become potentially
a parricide on convincing himself that the father has been a successful
rival. Psychologically he represents the type of unstable, weak-willed,
uninhibited being who cannot learn self-control. Such individuals
may pass unmarked so long as they live in orderly surroundings, but
as soon as they wander from the straight path they get into trouble.
Their irritability, manifested for the smallest cause, may give rise
to attacks of boundless fury which are further increased by alcohol,
and the gravest crimes are often committed in these conditions. The
normal inhibitions are entirely absent; there is no reflection, no
weighing of the costs. The thought which develops in the brain is at
once translated into action. Their actions are irrational, arbitrary,
dependent upon the moment, governed by accidental factors.

Despite overwhelming proof, Dimitri denies his guilt from the start.
It is an open question if the motive of this denial is repentance,
shame, love for Grushenka, or fear. The three experts of the trial each
has his own opinion. The first two declare Dimitri to be abnormal.
The third regards him as normal. The author himself has made it easy
to judge of Dimitri's state of mind. Though on the boundary line of
accountability, he is not in such a pathological condition as to
exclude his free determination; however, he is not fully responsible
for the crime, and extenuating circumstances have to be conceded by the
judge.

Smerdyakov, the illegitimate child of the idiot girl whom Karamazov
_pere_ raped on a wager and who eventually murders his father
(vicariously, as it were, his morality having been destroyed by Ivan),
is carefully delineated by Dostoievsky. He is epileptic. Not only are
the disease and its manifestations described, but there is a masterly
presentation of the personality alteration which so often accompanies
its progress. In childhood he is cruel, later solitary, suspicious,
and misanthropical. He has no sense of gratitude and he looks at the
world mistrustfully. When Fyodor Pavlovitch hears he has epilepsy he
takes interest in him, sees to it that he has treatment, and sends him
to Moscow to be trained as cook. During the three years of absence his
appearance changes remarkably. Here it may be remarked that though
Dostoievsky lived previous to our knowledge of the rôle that the
ductless glands play in maintaining the appearance and conserving the
nutritional equilibrium of the individual, he gives, in his delineation
of Smerdyakov, an extraordinarily accurate description of the somatic
and spiritual alteration that sometimes occurs when some of them
cease functioning. It is his art also to do it in a few words, just
as it is his art to forecast Smerdyakov's crime while discussing the
nature and occurrence of epileptic-attack equivalents, which he called
contemplations.

The way he disentangles the skeins from the confused mass of putridity,
disease, and crime of which this novel is constituted, has been the
marvel and inspiration of novelists the world over for the past fifty
years. Dimitri wants to kill his father for many reasons, but the one
that moves him to meditate it and plan it is: Grushenka, immoral and
unmoral, will then be beyond the monster's reach; Grushenka whose
sadism peeps out in her lust for Alyosha and who can't throw off
her feeling of submission for the man who had violated her when she
was seventeen. Dimitri loves Grushenka and Grushenka loves Dimitri
“abnormals with abnormal love which they idealised.” During an orgy
which would have pleased Nero, Dimitri lays drunken Grushenka on the
bed, and kisses her on the lips.

    “'Don't touch me,' she faltered in an imploring voice. 'Don't
    touch me till I am yours.... I have told you I am yours, but
    don't touch me ... spare me.... With them here, with them close
    you mustn't. He's here. It's nasty here.'”

He sinks on his knees by the bedside. He goes to his father's house at
a propitious time and suitably armed for murder; he hails him to the
window by giving the signal that he has learned from Smerdyakov would
apprise him of the approach of Grushenka; but before he can strike
him Smerdyakov, carrying out a plan of his own, despatches him, and
Dimitri flees. The latter half of the book is taken up with the trial
of Dimitri and the preliminaries to it, which give Dostoievsky an
opportunity to pay his respects to Jurisprudence and to medicine and
to depict a Slav hypocrite, Rahkitin. Smerdyakov commits the crime to
find favour in the eyes of his god Ivan. He knows that Ivan desired
it, suggested it, and went away knowing it was going to be done--at
least that is the impression the epileptic mind of Smerdyakov gets--and
under that impression he acts when he despatches his father with
the three-pound paper weight. The unprejudiced reader will feel the
sympathies that have gradually been aroused for Smerdyakov because
of his disease fade as he reads of the plan that the murderer made,
and when he has hung himself after confessing to Ivan. In proportion
as they recede for the valet, they will be rearoused for Ivan whose
brain now gives away under the hereditary and acquired burden. This
gives Dostoievsky the opportunity to depict the prodromata and early
manifestations of acute mania as they have never, before or since, been
depicted in lay literature.

Description of the visual hallucination which Ivan has in the early
stages, that a “Russian gentleman of a particular kind is present,”
and the delusion that he is having an interview with him, might have
been copied from the annals of an asylum, had they been recorded there
by a master of the narrative art. It is one of the first, and the most
successful attempts to depict dual personality, and to record the
beliefs and convictions of each side of the personality. He listens to
his _alter ego_ sit in judgment upon him and his previous conduct, and
is finally goaded by him to assault, as was Luther under similar though
less dramatic circumstances. “Voices,” as the delirious and insane
call them, have never been more accurately rendered than in the final
chapters of the Ivan section of the book.

An exhaustive psychosis displaying itself in intermittent delirium, and
occurring in a profoundly psychopathic individual, is the label that
a physician would give Ivan's disorder. Alyosha saw in it that God,
in whom Ivan disbelieved, and His truth were gaining mastery over his
heart, which still refused to submit.

“The Idiot” was one of Dostoievsky's books which had a cold reception
from the Russian reading public, but which has been, next to “The
Brothers Karamazov” and “Crime and Punishment,” the most popular in
this country. The basic idea is the representation of a truly perfect
and noble man, and it is not at all astonishing that Dostoievsky made
him an epileptic. He had been impressed, he said, that all writers who
had sought to represent Absolute Beauty were unequal to the task. It is
so difficult, for the beautiful is the ideal, and ideals have long been
wavering and waning in civilised Europe. There is only one figure of
absolute beauty, Christ, and he patterns Prince Myshkin upon the Divine
model. He brings him in contact with Nastasya Filipovna, who is the
incarnation of the evil done in the world, and this evil is represented
symbolically by Dostoievsky as the outrage of a child. The nine years
of brooding which had followed the outrage inflicted upon Nastasya as
a child by Prince Tosky had imprinted upon her face something which
Myshkin recognises as the pain of the world, and from the thought of
which he cannot deliver himself, and which he cannot mitigate for her.
She marries him after agonies of rebellion, after having given him to
her _alter ego_ in virginal state, Aglaia Epanchin, and then takes
him away to show her power and demonstrate her own weakness; but she
deserts him on the church steps for her lover Rogozhin, who murders
her that night. Myshkin, finding Rogozhin next morning, says more than
“Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.” He lies beside him
in the night and bathes his temples with his tears, but fortunately in
the morning when the murderer is a raving lunatic a merciful Providence
has enshrouded Myshkin in his disease.

As Dimitri Merejkowski, the most understanding critic and interpreter
of Dostoievsky who has written of him, truthfully says, his works are
not novels or epics, but tragedies. The narrative is secondary to the
construction of the whole work, and the keystone of the narrative is
the dialogue between the characters. The reader feels that he hears
real persons talking and talking without artifice, just as they would
talk in real life; and they express sentiments and convictions which
one would expect from individuals of such inheritance, education,
development, and environment, obsessed particularly with the
injustices of this world and the uncertainties of the world to be,
concerned day and night with the immortality of the soul, the existence
of God, and the future of civilisation.

It has been said that he does not describe the appearance of his
characters, for they depict themselves, their thoughts and feelings,
their faces and bodies, by their peculiar forms of language and tones
of voice. Although he does not dwell on portraiture, he has scarcely a
rival in delineation, and his portraits have that quality which perhaps
Leonardo of all who worked with the brush had the capacity to portray,
and which Pater saw in the _Gioconda_; the revelation of the soul and
its possibilities in the lineaments. The portrait of Mlle. Lebyadkin,
the imbecile whom the proud Nikolay Stavrogin married, not from love
or lust, but that he might exhaust the list of mortifications, those
of the flesh, for himself, and those of pride for his family; that he
might kill his instincts and become pure spirit, is as true to life as
if Dostoievsky had spent his existence in an almshouse sketching the
unfortunates segregated there. The art of portraiture cannot surpass
this picture of Shatov, upon whose plastic soul Stavrogin impressed his
immoralities in the shape of “the grand idea” and who said to Stavrogin
in his agony, “Sha'n't I kiss your foot-prints when you've gone? I
can't tear you out of my heart, Nikolay Stavrogin:”

    “He was short, awkward, had a shock of flaxen hair, broad
    shoulders, thick lips, very thick overhanging white eyebrows, a
    wrinkled forehead, and a hostile, obstinately downcast, as it
    were shamefaced, expression in his eyes. His hair was always
    in a wild tangle and stood up in a shock which nothing could
    smooth. He was seven or eight and twenty.”

It is not as a photographer of the body that Dostoievsky is a source
of power and inspiration in the world today, and will remain so for
countless days to come--for he has depicted the Russian people as has
no one else save Tolstoi, and his pictures constitute historical
documents--but as a photographer of the soul, a psychologist.
Psychology is said to be a new science, and a generation ago there was
much ado over a new development called “experimental psychology,” which
was hailed as the key that would unlock the casket wherein repose the
secrets of the mind; the windlass that would lift layer by layer the
veil that has, since man began, concealed the mysteries of thought,
behaviour, and action. It has not fulfilled its promise. It would be
beyond the truth to say that it has been sterile, but it is quite true
to say that the contributions which it has made have been as naught
compared with those made by abnormal psychology. Some, indeed, contend
that the only real psychological contributions of value have come from
a study of disease and deficiency, and their contentions are granted by
the vast majority of those entitled to opinion.

Dostoievsky is the master portrayer of madness and of bizarre states
of the soul and of the mind that are on the borderland of madness.
Not only has he depicted the different types of mental alienation,
but by an intuition peculiar to his genius, by a species of artistic
divination, he has understood and portrayed their display, their
causation, their onset--so often difficult to determine even for the
expert--and finally the full development of the disease. Indeed,
he forestalled the description of the alienists. “They call me a
psychologist,” says Dostoievsky; “it is not true. I am only a realist
in the highest sense of the word, that is I depict all the soul's
depth. Arid observations of every-day trivialities I have long ceased
to regard as realism--it is quite the reverse.”

It is the mission of one important branch of psychology to depict the
soul's depth, the workings of the conscious mind, and as the interior
of a house that one is forbidden to enter is best seen when the house
has been shattered or is succumbing to the incidences of time and
existence, so the contents of the soul are most discernible in the
mind that has some of its impenetralia removed by disease. It was in
this laboratory that Dostoievsky conducted his experiments, made his
observations, and recorded the results from which he drew conclusions
and inferences. “In my works I have never said so much as the twentieth
part of what I wished to say, and perhaps could actually have said. I
am firmly convinced that mankind knows much more than it has hitherto
expressed either in science or in art. In what I have written there
is much that came from the depth of my heart,” he says in a letter to
a friendly critic, to which may be added that what he has said is in
keeping with the science of today, and is corroborated by workers in
other fields of psychology and psychiatry.

“The Possessed,” in which Dostoievsky reached the high-water mark of
personality analysis, has always been a stumbling block to critics
and interpreters. The recent publication by the Russian Government of
a pamphlet containing “Stavrogin's Confession” sheds an illuminating
light on the hero; and even second-hand knowledge of what has gone
on in Russia, politically and socially, during the past six years
facilitates an understanding of Pyotr Stepanovitch, Satan's impresario,
and of Kirillov, nihilist.

The task that Dostoievsky set himself in “The Possessed” was not
unlike that which the Marquis de Sade set himself in “Justine, or the
Misfortunes of Virtue,” and Sacher-Masoch in “Liebesgeschichten”; viz.,
to narrate the life of an unfortunate creature whose most important
fundamental instinct was perverted and who could get the full flavour
of pleasure only by inflicting cruelty, causing pain, or engendering
humiliation.

    “Every unusually disgraceful, utterly degrading, dastardly, and
    above all, ridiculous situation in which I ever happened to
    be in my life, always roused in me, side by side with extreme
    anger, an incredible delight.”

Stavrogin was apparently favoured by fortune: he had charm, education,
wealth, and health. In reality he was handicapped to an incalculable
degree. After a brilliant brief career in the army and in St.
Petersburg society, he withdrew from both and associated with the dregs
of the population of that city, with slip-shod government clerks,
discharged military men, beggars of the higher class, and drunkards of
all sorts. He visited their filthy families, spent days and nights in
dark slums and all sorts of low haunts. He threw suspicion of theft
on the twelve-year-old daughter of a woman who rented him a room for
assignations that he might see her thrashed, and a few days later he
raped her. The next day he hated her so he decided to kill her and
was preparing to do so when she hanged herself. This is not featured
in the novel as it now stands. Until the publication of “Stavrogin's
Confession” interpreters of Stavrogin's personality who maintained
that he was a sadist were accused of having read something into his
character that Dostoievsky did not intend him to have. After committing
this “greatest sin in the world,” he determined to cripple his life
in the most disgusting way possible, that he might pain his mother,
humiliate his family, and shock society. He would marry Marya, a
hemiplegic idiot who tidied up his room. After the ceremony he went
to stay with his mother, the granddame of their province. He went to
distract himself, which included seducing and enslaving Darya, Shatov's
sister, a ward of his mother, and a member of the family.

Suddenly, apropos of nothing, he was guilty of incredible outrages
upon various persons and, what was most enigmatic, these outrages
were utterly unheard of, quite inconceivable, entirely unprovoked and
objectless. For instance, one day at the club, he tweaked the nose of
an elderly man of high rank in the service. When the Governor of the
club sought some explanation Stavrogin told him he would whisper it in
his ear.

    “When the dear, mild Ivan Ossipovitch hurriedly and trustfully
    inclined his ear Stavrogin bit it hard. The poor Governor would
    have died of terror but the monster had mercy on him, and let go
    his ear.”

The doctor testified that he was temporarily unbalanced, and after a
few weeks' rest and isolation he went abroad for four years and there
Lizaveta Nikolaevna, Shatov's wife, and several others succumbed, and
he also met his old tutor's son, Pyotr Stepanovitch, his deputy in
the Internationale, who from that moment became his apologist, his
tool, his agent, and finally the instrument of his destruction. The
gratification of Stavrogin's perverted passion, the machinations of the
Republicans and nihilists, and the revelations of Shatov's limitations
and of Mr. Kirillov's nihilistic idealism are the threads of the story.
Shatov was the son of a former valet of Stavrogin's mother who had been
expelled from the University after some disturbance, a radical with a
tender heart, who had held Stavrogin up as an ideal.

    “He was one of those idealistic beings common in Russia who are
    suddenly struck by some overmastering idea which seems, as it
    were, to crush them at once and sometimes for ever. They are
    never equal to coping with it, but put passionate faith in it,
    and their whole life passes afterward, as it were, in the last
    agonies under the weight of the stone that has fallen upon them
    and half crushed them.”

Shatov's overmastering idea was that Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch could do
no wrong, and the stone that crushed him was Nikolay's misdeeds. Mr.
Kirillov, the engineer, believed that he who conquers pain and terror
will become a god.

    “Then there will be a new life, a new man, everything will be
    new ... then they will divide history into two parts: from the
    gorilla to the annihilation of God, and from the annihilation of
    God to the transformation of the earth and of man physically.
    Man will be God and will be transformed physically and all men
    will kill themselves.”

“He who kills himself only to kill fear will become a god at once.”
Kirillov believed or feared that eternal life was now, not hereafter.
There are moments when time suddenly stands still for men, and it
was fear that it might become eternal that he could not tolerate. In
Dostoievsky's books there is always one contemptible character, a
sanctimonious hypocrite, a fawning holier-than-thou, a pious scandal
monger, a venomous volunteer of first aid to the morally injured. In
this book his name is Liputin, an elderly provincial official.

These are the chief figures of the drama.

When Shatov had been killed; when Kirillov's promise: namely, that he
would commit suicide on request, had been exacted; when Stavrogin's
imbecile wife and her brother Lebyadkin had been despatched; when
Lisa, who was abducted by Stavrogin on the eve of her marriage and
then abandoned, had been knocked on the head and killed by the mob
because she was Stavrogin's woman who “had come to look at the wife
he had murdered”; when Shatov's wife had come back to him and borne
Stavrogin's child in his presence; when Stepan Trofimovitch had
displayed his last infantile reaction and his son Peter, the Russian
Mephistopheles, had made a quick and successful get-away, Stavrogin
wrote to Darya and suggested that she go with him to the Canton of
Uri, of which he was a citizen, and be his nurse. Darya, for whom
humiliation spelled happiness, consented and Varvara Petrovna, hearing
of the plan, succumbed to the sway of maternal love and arranged to go
with them.

The day they had planned to begin their journey Stavrogin was not to be
found, but search of the loft revealed his body hanging from a hook by
means of a silken cord which had been carefully soaped before he slung
it around his neck.

At the inquest the doctors absolutely and emphatically rejected all
idea of insanity.

“The Possessed” has been the most enigmatic of the writer's books
because critics could not agree as to the motives of Stavrogin's crimes
and conduct. With the publication of “Stavrogin's Confession” the
riddles were solved. In the book as originally planned (and modified
at the request of the publisher of the periodical in which the novel
originally appeared), Stavrogin, instead of hanging himself, went
to Our Lady Spasso-Efimev Monastery and confessed himself to Bishop
Tikhon. Dostoievsky recruited his spiritual _menschenkenners_ from
the ranks of those who, in youth, had played the game of life hard,
transgressed, and repented. Tikhon was one of them, a strange composite
of piety and worldliness chained to his cell by chronic rheumatism and
alcoholic tremours.

Stavrogin had been obsessed by a phrase from the Apocalypse: “I know
thy works; that thou art neither hot nor cold. I would thou wert cold
or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
I will spew thee out of my mouth.” He would be lukewarm no longer. He
handed Tikhon three little sheets of ordinary small-sized writing paper
printed and stitched together. It was entitled “From Stavrogin” and
was a confession of his sins. He couldn't dislodge from his mind the
vision of the little girl Matryosha. He identified her with photographs
of children that he saw in shop windows. A spider on a geranium leaf
caused the vision of her as she killed herself to rise up before him,
and this vision came to him now every day and every night

    “not that it comes itself, but that I bring it before myself and
    cannot help bringing it although I can't live with it. I know I
    can dismiss the thought of Matryosha even now whenever I want
    to. I am as completely master of my will as ever. But the whole
    point is that I never wanted to do it; I myself do not want to,
    and never shall.”

Tikhon suggested that he would be forgiven if his repentance was
sincere, and told him he knew an old man, a hermit and ascetic of such
great Christian wisdom that he was beyond ordinary understanding. He
suggested that Stavrogin should go to him, into retreat, as novice
under his guidance, for five years, or seven, for as many as were
necessary. He adjured him to make a vow to himself so that by this
great sacrifice he would acquire all that he longed for and didn't
even expect, and assured him that he could not possibly realise now
what he would obtain from such guidance and isolation and repentance.

Stavrogin hesitated and the Bishop suddenly realised that he had no
intention of repenting. It dawned upon him that Stavrogin's plan was to
flaunt his sin in the face of God as he had previously flaunted it in
the face of society, and in a voice which penetrated the soul and with
an expression of the most violent grief Tikhon exclaimed,

    “Poor lost youth, you have never been so near another and a
    still greater crime as you are at this moment. Before the
    publication of the 'Confession,' a day, an hour perhaps before
    the great step, you will throw yourself on another crime, as a
    way out, and you will commit it solely in order to avoid the
    publication of these pages.”

Stavrogin shuddered with anger and almost with fear and shouted “You
cursed psychologist!,” and left the cell without looking at Tikhon.

The annihilation of the sense of time in Dostoievsky's stories was
first dwelt upon by Merejkowski, and it has been much discussed by all
of his serious commentators. Events occur and things take place within
a few hours in his books which would ordinarily take months and years.
The reason for this timeless cycle of events may be sought in the
experiences that the author had in the moments preceding his attacks of
epilepsy in which he had thoughts and emotions which a lifetime would
scarcely suffice to narrate.

Dostoievsky is the greatest of subjective writers because he goes
deepest and is the most truthful. His books are narratives of sins and
crimes and descriptions of attempts at expiation. He didn't invent
sins, he took them from life; he presented those he had committed and
seen committed. He invented only the expiation, and some of that,
it must be admitted, he experienced. His sinners are never normal
mentally. They are never insane legally, but all of them are insane
medically.

Dostoievsky himself was far from “normal” mentally, aside from his
epilepsy, though he made approximation to it as he grew older. His
mind was a garden sown with the flower seeds of virtue and the thistle
seeds of vice. All of them germinated. Some became full blown, others
remained stunted and dwarfed.

    “I have invented a new kind of enjoyment for myself,” he wrote
    to his brother, “a most strange one--to make myself suffer. I
    take your letter, turn it over in my hand for several minutes,
    feel if it is full weight, and having looked on it sufficiently
    and admired the closed envelope, I put it in my pocket. You
    won't believe what a voluptuous state of soul, feeling and heart
    there is in that!”

That is the _anlage_ of masochism. In the outline of “The Life of a
Great Sinner,” the novel whose completion would permit him to die in
peace, for then he should have expressed himself completely, one sees
the wealth of detail taken by the author from his boyhood and early
manhood. The hero of the “Life” was unsociable and uncommunicative;
a proud, passionate, and domineering nature. So was Dostoievsky. So
here was to be apotheosis of individualism, consciousness of his
superiority, of his determination, and of his uniqueness. Dostoievsky
wrote of himself in 1867, “Everywhere and in everything I reach the
furthest limits; I have passed beyond the boundaries of all life.”

The most inattentive reader of his “Letters” will be reminded of
Dostoievsky when they read that the hero of the “Life” “surprised
everybody by unexpectedly rude pranks,” “behaved like a monster,”
“offended an old woman,” and that he was obsessed with the idea of
amassing money; and the alternative stages of belief and disbelief of
the hero are obviously recollections of his own trials. “I believe I
shall express the whole of myself in it” he wrote of it to a friend,
and no one familiar with his books and his life can read the outline
of it and doubt that he would have succeeded. Wherever Dostoievsky
looked he saw a question mark and before it was written “Is there a
God? Does God exist?” He was determined to find the answer. He had
found Christ abundantly and satisfactorily, but the God of Job he never
knew, nor had He ever overthrown him or compassed him with His net.

Dostoievsky was a rare example of dual personality. His life was the
expression of his ego personality (and what a life of strife and misery
and unhappiness it was!), revealed with extraordinary lucidity in his
“Letters” and “The Journal of an Author”; and his legacy to mankind
is the record of his unconscious mind revealed in his novels. The
latter is the life he would have liked to live, and in it he depicts
the changes in man's moral nature that he would have liked to witness.
His contention was that man should be master of his fate, captain of
his soul. He must express his thought and conviction in action and
conduct, particularly in his relation to his fellow-man. He must take
life's measure and go to it no matter what it entails or how painful,
unpleasant, or disastrous the struggle, or the end.

Many thoughtful minds believe that Dostoievsky has shown us the only
salvation in the great crisis of the European conscience. The people,
it matters not of what nationality, still possess the strength and
equilibrium of internal power. The conviction that man shall not live
as a beast of burden still survives in the Russian people and is shared
with them by the masses throughout the civilised world. Salvation from
internal anarchy was his plea, and it is the plea that is today being
made by millions in other lands than his.

As a prophet he foresaw the supremacy of the Russian people, the
common people succoured to knowledge, faith, and understanding by
liberty, education, and health, and by conformation to its teaching
the Renaissance of the Christian faith, which shall be a faith that
shall show man how to live and how to die, and which shall be manifest
in conduct as well as by word of mouth; primacy of the Russian church;
and the consummation of European culture by the effort and propaganda
of Russia. “Russia is the one God-fearing nation and her ultimate
destiny shall be to make known the Russian Christ for the salvation
of lost humanity.” No one can say at this day that his prophecies may
not come true, and to the student of history there may seem to be more
suggestive indication of it in the Russia of today than in that of half
a century ago; for from a world in ferment unexpected distillations
may flow. But to the person who needs proof Russia is silent now.
Dostoievsky's doctrines have not dropped as the rain, nor has his
speech been distilled as the dew, though he published the name of the
Lord and ascribed greatness unto our God. Indeed, the fate that has
overtaken Russia would seem to deny the possibility of the fulfillment
of his prophecies either for his country or his people.

As a narrator of the events of life here, and of the thoughts of life
here and hereafter, he has had few peers of any nation or language.
That he did it in a disorderly way must be admitted; that the events of
his tragedies had little time incidence is obvious to the most casual
reader; that the reader has to bring to their perusal concentration
and application is beyond debate; and that his characters are
“degenerates,” using that word in its biological sense, there is no
doubt. But despite these defects, Dostoievsky succeeds in straining the
essence of the Russian's soul through his unconscious to his conscious
mind, and then expressing it; and his books are the imperishable
soul-prints of his contemporaneous countrymen. Not only does he stand
highest in literary achievement of all men of his time, but he is a
figure of international significance in the world of literature. His
life and struggle was Hauptmann's song,

    “Always must the heart-strings vibrate in the breath of the
    world's sorrow, for the world's sorrow is the root of heaven's
    desire.”

He foresaw with clairvoyancy the necessity of making religion livable,
not professed with the lips and scorned in action, but a code or
formulation that would combine Life, Love, and Light pragmatically;
and although he was not able to formulate his thought or to express
it clearly and forcibly, to synthetise and codify it, as it were,
formulators of the new religion, of Christianity revivified or
dematerialised, will consult frequently and diligently the writings of
Feodor Dostoievsky.




                              CHAPTER IV
                   DOROTHY RICHARDSON AND HER CENSOR


The novelists are behind the naturalists in the recording of minutiæ.
Many of the latter have set down the life history of certain species
of birds in exhaustive detail--every flip of the tail, every peck
preceding the grand drama of courtship and marriage, every solicitude
of paternity, every callousness of guardianship.

An analogous contribution to realism in the domain of fiction has
been made by Dorothy M. Richardson, an interesting figure in English
literature today. She has written six books about herself. When one
considers that her life has been uneventful, one might say drab,
commonplace, and restricted, this is an accomplishment deserving of
note and comment.

Critics and connoisseurs of literary craftsmanship have given her a
high rating, but they have not succeeded in introducing her to the
reading public. She is probably the least known distinguished writer
of fiction in England, but she has a certain public both in her own
country, and in this in which all her novels have been republished.

Her influence on the output of English fiction since the publication
of “Pointed Roofs,” in 1913, is one of the outstanding features in
the evolution of novel-writing during the present decade. Since
Flaubert set the pace for a reaction against the conception of the
realistic novel as the faithful transcription of life as perceived
by the novelist; and his followers introduced into novel-writing a
more subtle art than that of mere transcription of life, by making
the hypothetical consciousness through which the story is presented
a determining factor in its essence, this factor has been assuming a
more and more important rôle. The autobiographical novel, tracing its
lineage straight back to Rousseau, has become a prevailing fashion
in fiction. It remained, however, for Miss Richardson to give the
example--aside from James Joyce and Marcel Proust--of a novel in which
the consciousness of the writer should assume the leading rôle in a
drama that just missed being a monologue. Miss Richardson has made,
not herself in the ordinary sense of the word, but her subjective
consciousness, the heroine of her narrative; and the burden of it has
been to present the development of this consciousness, or energy,
directly to the reader in all its crudity and its dominancy. The
result is a novel without plot, practically without story interest.
It is a question what influence this “artistic subjectivism,” as Mr.
J. Middleton Murry has called it, will have upon the fiction of the
future. Of its influence upon that of the present there can be no
question.

Her technique is intensive, netting in words the continuous flow of
consciousness and semi-consciousness. She is first and foremost a
symbolist, an exponent of autistic thinking, a recorder of the product
of what is called by the popular psychology her “unconscious mind,”
which has got by the “censor,” a mythical sort of policeman who, in her
case, often sleeps on his post, or is so dazed by the supply from her
unconscious he cannot carry on.

This recently rechristened official, from the baptismal font of the
Freudians, is responsible for much literature of questionable value.
Latterly he has become something of a radical and has been permitting
stuff to get by on many wires and postal avenues that seems to those
whose “censors” have been doing duty in the name of Reason or _Amour
Propre_ to be, if not immoral, at least indecent. Miss Richardson's
“censor” is a Socialist, but he is not a Red. He hasn't much time for
appearances and diplomacy, and he has so many fish to fry that he
cannot have all his time taken up with putting his best foot forward.
Therefore Miriam Henderson doesn't believe in the religion of her
forebears, she isn't strong for the National cause, and she doesn't
hark to any party cry. She doesn't like her mother, and it is the
tendency of the modern “censor” to emphasise that; but to “pater”
her allegory and her ordered stream of thought are uniformly kind
and indulgent. Her “censor” early in life warned her that he was no
parent of shams and if she wanted to live a peaceful life she must
be unconventional. So Miriam determined to be “different.” She is
unsociable. She cannot think of anyone who does not offend her. “I
don't like men and I loathe women. I am a misanthrope. So is pater.”
He further assured her that “freedom” is the gateway and roadway to
happiness, and to travel thereon, with a little money to satisfy the
self-preservative urge, constituted the joy of life. Up to this point
Miriam and the “censor” got on famously. It was when he announced that
he was determined not to exhaust himself keeping down her untutored
passions that she revealed a determination that staggered him. The
“censor” capitulated. The result is that Miss Richardson's books are of
all symbolic literature the least concerned with the sinfulness of the
flesh, therefore furthest removed from comedy.

Miriam Henderson--who is Dorothy M. Richardson, the narrator of her
own life--is the third of four daughters of a silly, inane, resigned
little mother and an unsocial father of artistic temperament, the son
of a tradesman whose ruling passion is to be considered a country
gentleman. His attitude toward life and his efforts to sustain it have
culminated in financial ruin, and Miriam finds herself at the age of
eighteen, all reluctant and unprepared, confronted with the necessity
of depending upon her own efforts for a living--unless she can achieve
escape, as do two of her sisters, in marriage. She meets the situation
bravely--cowardice is not one of her faults--and the six books contain
a statement of her struggles against circumstance and a psychological
analysis of her personality. As self is less able to accept compromises
or to make adaptations in her case than in that of the average mortal,
the conflict is fierce; but it is soul struggle, not action.

Miriam's first tilt with life, recorded in “Pointed Roofs,” is as
a governess in a small German boarding-school, from which she is
politely dismissed, without assigned reason, at the close of the
first term. Her second, in “Backwater,” is as a teacher of drab
youngsters in a North London school. After less than a year, ennui,
restlessness, and discontent compel her to resign without definite
outlook or prospects. The situation suddenly becomes unendurable after a few months--for no
stated reason--and she eagerly seeks escape in her mother's illness. In
“The Tunnel” she at last finds a “job” to her taste when she becomes
assistant in the office of several London dentists, and denizen of a
hall bedroom in a dismal Bloomsbury rooming-house. In “Interim” she
loses her opportunity of marrying a wholesome Canadian by flirting with
a Spanish Jew. And in “Deadlock” she puts forth her first tentative
efforts to write and becomes engaged to a man with whom she believes
herself to be in love, but of whom she does not intellectually approve.

Her next novel is likely to be called “Impasse,” for meanwhile, in real
life, Miss Richardson has married and a new element has been introduced
into her life which she will not be able to keep from tincturing and
tinting her “unconscious,” but which she will not be able to get past
her “censor.” It would not surprise us either should she switch from
this series and cast her next book in the form of an episode or short
story. Revelations of impulses, thoughts, determinations have been
considered “good form” in literature when they were one's own, but when
they were another's, submitted to the narrator's judgement or reason,
especially a wife's or a husband's, it has been considered bad taste
either to narrate or to publish them. Moreover the alleged facts are
always questioned.

In the six books, whose titles are symbolic and which were originally
meant to be grouped under the one head of “Pilgrimage”--her adventure
of life--the author has presented what might be described as a cinema
of her mind, not particularly what the New Psychology calls, with
all the assurance of infallibility, the “unconscious mind.” She has
the faculty of taking a canvas and jotting down everything she sees
in a landscape and then finishing it in the studio in such a way as
to convince the person who has seen similar landscapes or who has an
eye for scenic beauty that her work is nearly perfect. She does it by
a skillful blending of the mind products of purposeful and autistic
thinking.

The autonomic mechanism of man displays the closest approximation to
perpetual motion that exists. It never rests. As yet we do not know
how far thought is conditioned by the autonomic nervous system, but
we know that the mind is never idle any more than the heart or the
lungs. Constantly a stream of thoughts flows from it or through it.
These thoughts vary in quality and quantity, and their variations
have formed endless and bitter discussions of psychologists. Whenever
the waking mind is not entirely occupied with directed thoughts, it
is filled with a succession of more or less vivid or vague thoughts,
often popularly referred to as “impressions,” which seem to arise
spontaneously and are usually not directed toward any recognised end or
purpose. A significant feature of them is the prominence of agreeable
impressions concerning oneself, people or things--or thoughts of these
as one would wish them to be, rather than as they are known to be. It
is these autistic, or wishful thoughts, which, constantly bubbling
up to the surface of consciousness like the water of a spring, give
colour to personality. They reveal it more luminously than anything
else--unless one goes still deeper and lays bare the thoughts at the
hidden source of the spring, thus penetrating the unconscious itself,
as the Freudians claim to do through the symbolism of dreams.

Whether Miriam Henderson, proceeding in this fashion, revealed more
of her real self than did Marie Bashkirtseff, or Anatole France in
“Le Petit Pierre,” “La Vie en Fleur” and the other charming books
with which he has been ornamenting his old age, is an open question.
However, Dorothy M. Richardson has established a reputation as one of
the few Simon-pure realists of modern English literature.

Another faculty which is developed to an exceptional degree in Miriam
is what psychologists call the association of cognitions and memories.
The “Wearin' of the Green” on a hand organ while she is big with
thoughts of what her trip to a foreign land may bring her makes her
think of

    “rambles in the hot school garden singing 'Gather roses while
    ye may,' hot afternoons in the shady north room, the sound of
    turning pages, the hum of the garden beyond the sun-blinds,
    meeting in the sixth form study ... Lilla with her black hair
    and the specks of bright amber in the brown of her eyes, talking
    about free-will.”

Then she stirs the fire and back her thoughts whisk to her immediate
concerns.

Music more than anything else calls into dominancy these associated
recollections. Listening to the playing of one of the schoolgirls at
the German school she suddenly realises:

    “That wonderful light was coming again--she had forgotten
    her sewing--when presently she saw, slowly circling, fading
    and clearing, first its edge, and then, for a moment the
    whole thing, dripping, dripping as it circled, a weed-grown
    mill-wheel.... She recognised it instantly. She had seen it
    somewhere as a child--in Devonshire--and never thought of it
    since--and there it was. She heard the soft swish and drip
    of the water and the low humming of the wheel. How beautiful
    ... it was fading.... She held it--it returned--clearer this
    time and she could feel the cool breeze it made, and sniff
    the fresh earthly smell of it, the scent of the moss and the
    weeds shining and dripping on its huge rim. Her heart filled.
    She felt a little tremour in her throat. All at once she knew
    that if she went on listening to that humming wheel and feeling
    the freshness of the air, she would cry. She pulled herself
    together, and for a while saw only a vague radiance in the room
    and the dim forms grouped about. She could not remember which
    was which. All seemed good and dear to her. The trumpet notes
    had come back, and in a few minutes the music ceased.... Someone
    was closing the great doors from inside the schoolroom.”

It would be difficult to find in literature a better illustration
of revival of unconscious or “forgotten” memory than this. An
extraordinary thing about it is that these and similar revivals are
preceded by an aura or warning in the shape of a light, similar to the
warnings that Dostoievsky had before having an epileptic attack during
which he experienced ecstasy so intense and overpowering that had it
lasted more than a few seconds the human mechanism would have broken
beneath the display. Miriam's ecstasy is of a milder sort, and the
result is like that which the occupant of a chamber with drawn blinds
and sealed windows might experience should some magic power stealthily
and in a mysterious way flood it gradually with sunshine and replace
the stale atmosphere with fresh air.

Many can testify from personal experience the power that music has to
influence purposeful thinking. It would not astonish me to hear that
Einstein had solved some of the intricate problems of “relativity”
under the direct influence of the music of Beethoven, Wagner, or Liszt.
It is the rod with which most temperamental persons smite the rock of
reality that romance may gush out and refresh those who thirst for it.
Miriam often wields the rod in her early days to the reader's intense
delight.

While giving Miss Richardson her full measure of praise as recorder of
her unconscious mental activity in poetic and romantic strain, we must
not overlook her unusual capacity to delineate the realities of life,
as they are anticipated and encountered.

The description of her preparation for going away in the first chapter
of “Pointed Roofs” is perfect realism: the thoughts of a young girl
in whom a conflict between self-depreciation and self-appreciation
is taking place. This is marvellously portrayed in the narration of
her thoughts and apprehensions of her ability to teach English in the
German school to which she is journeying. It is a fool's errand to be
going there with nothing to give. She doubts whether she can repeat the
alphabet, let alone parse and analyse.

This mastery of realism is displayed throughout the series. The
inwardly rebellious governess in the country house of prosperous people
is made vivid in her setting when she says:

    “There was to be another week-end. Again there would be the
    sense of being a visitor amongst other visitors; visitor was not
    the word; there was a French word which described the thing,
    'convive,' 'les convives' ... people sitting easily about a
    table with flushed faces ... someone standing drunkenly up with
    eyes blazing with friendliness and a raised wineglass ... women
    and wine, the rose of Heliogabalus; but he was a Greek and
    dreadful in some way, convives were Latin, Roman; fountains,
    water flowing over marble, white-robed strong-faced people
    reclining on marble couches, feasting ... taking each fair mask
    for what it shows itself; that was what this kind of wealthy
    English people did, perhaps what all wealthy people did ... the
    maimed, the halt, the blind, _compel_ them to come in ... but
    that was after the others had refused. The thing that made you
    feel jolliest and strongest was to forget the maimed, to _be_ a
    fair mask, to keep everything else out and be a little circle of
    people knowing that everything was kept out. Suppose a skeleton
    walked in? Offer it a glass of wine. People have no right to be
    skeletons, or if they are to make a fuss about it. These people
    would be all the brighter if they happened to have neuralgia;
    some pain or emotion made you able to do things. Taking each
    fair mask was a fine grown-up game. Perhaps it could be kept up
    to the end? Perhaps that was the meaning of the man playing
    cards on his death-bed.”

The author has the gift of narration, too, of making a picture with a
few sweeps of the brush. In “Pointed Roofs” Miriam gives a synopsis
of her parents and their limitations in a few words, which is nearly
perfect. She does it by narration of her thoughts in retrospection,
which is another striking feature of her technique.

    “She thought sleepily of her Wesleyan grandparents, gravely
    reading the 'Wesleyan Methodist Recorder,' the shop at
    Babington, her father's discontent, his solitary fishing and
    reading, his discovery of music ... science ... classical
    music in the first Novello editions ... Faraday ... speaking
    to Faraday after lectures. Marriage ... the new house ... the
    red brick wall at the end of the garden where young peach-trees
    were planted ... running up and downstairs and singing ... both
    of them singing in the rooms and the garden ... she sometimes
    with her hair down and then when visitors were expected pinned
    in coils under a little cap and wearing a small hoop ... the
    garden and lawns and shrubbery and the long kitchen-garden
    and the summer-house under the oaks beyond and the pretty
    old gabled 'town' on the river and the woods all along the
    river valley and the hills shining up out of the mist. The
    snow man they both made in the winter--the birth of Sarah
    and then Eve ... his studies and book-buying--and after five
    years her own disappointing birth as the third girl, and the
    coming of Harriet just a year later ... her mother's illness,
    money troubles--their two years at the sea to retrieve ...
    the disappearance of the sunlit red-walled garden always in
    full summer sunshine with the sound of bees in it or dark
    from windows ... the narrowings of the house-life down to the
    Marine Villa--with the sea creeping in--wading out through
    the green shallows, out and out till you were more than waist
    deep--shrimping and prawning hour after hour for weeks together
    ... poking in the rock pools, watching the sun and the colours
    in the strange afternoons ... then the sudden large house
    at Barnes with the 'drive' winding to the door.... He used
    to come home from the City and the Constitutional Club and
    sometimes instead of reading 'The Times' or the 'Globe' or the
    'Proceedings of the British Association' or Herbert Spencer,
    play Pope Joan or Jacoby with them all, or Table Billiards and
    laugh and be 'silly' and take his turn at being 'bumped' by
    Timmy going the round of the long dining-room table, tail in
    the air; he had taken Sarah and Eve to see 'Don Giovanni' and
    'Winter's Tale' and the new piece, 'Lohengrin.' No one at the
    tennis-club had seen that. He had good taste. No one else had
    been to Madame Schumann's Farewell ... sitting at the piano
    with her curtains of hair and her dreamy smile ... and the
    Philharmonic Concerts. No one else knew about the lectures at
    the Royal Institution, beginning at nine on Fridays.... No one
    else's father went with a party of scientific men 'for the
    advancement of science' to Norway or America, seeing the Falls
    and the Yosemite Valley. No one else took his children as far as
    Dawlish for the holidays, travelling all day, from eight until
    seven ... no esplanade, the old stone jetty and coves and cowrie
    shells....”

Nature was in a satirical mood when she equipped Miriam for her
conflict. Early the casual reader recognises her as the kind of girl
who is socially difficult and who seems predestined to do “fool
things.” The psychologist looks deeper and sees a tragic jest. Plain
in appearance, angular in manner, innocent of subtlety, suppleness,
or graciousness of body or soul, with a fine sensitiveness fed by
an abnormal self-appreciation, which she succeeds in covering only
at the cost of inducing in it a hot-house growth, Miriam Henderson
enters upon the task of an unskilled wage-earner with a mind turned
inward and possessed by that modern and fashionable demon politely
known as a “floating libido.” Dogged, if not actually damned, by her
special devil, Miriam is driven in frenzied and blinded unrest from
one experience to another, in vain efforts to appease its insistent
demands, placing the blame for her failure to achieve either success or
happiness everywhere except where it belongs.

Tortured by romantic sentimentalism unrelieved by a glimmer of
imagination or humour; over-sexed but lacking the magnetism without
which her sex was as bread without yeast; with a desire for adulation
so morbid that it surrounded itself with defences of hatred and
envy, Miriam's demon drove or lured her through tangled mazes of the
soul-game, and checkmated every effort to find herself through her
experiences.

In “Pointed Roofs,” even through the wall of self, the reader catches
the charm with which the German school held Miriam, in the music
floating through the big _saal_, the snatches of schoolgirl slang and
whimsical wisdom, and Fraulein Pfaff with her superstitions, her rages,
her religiosity, and her sensuality. But this is the background of the
picture, just as the background of the home which she had so clingingly
left had been the three light-hearted sisters with their white plump
hands and feminine graces, the tennis, the long, easy dreamy days; and
the foreground had been Miriam cherishing a feeling of “difference”
toward the feminine sisters, feeding her smarting self-love by her
fancied resemblance to her father who hated men and loathed women,
and dreaming of the “white twinkling figure coming quickly along the
pathway between the rows of hollyhocks every Sunday afternoon.”

The “high spot” in her experience at the German school is revealed in
the answer to the question: Why could not Miriam get on with “tall
Fraulein Pfaff smiling her horse smile”? Miriam leaves the school
cloaked in injured innocence. But the cloak is no mask for the native
wit of the schoolgirls. They know--and Miriam knows--that the answer
is the old Swiss teacher of French upon whom the Fraulein herself has
designs. Even before he is revealed reading poetry to the class with
a simper while Miriam makes eyes at him, or in a purported chance
encounter alone in the _saal_, the girls have twitted Miriam in a way
that would have warned a more sensible girl that she was venturing upon
dangerous ground. But Miriam's demon had made her insensible to such
hints, just as it had robbed her of the common sense which would have
made her understand, even without warnings, that she could not work for
a woman and “go vamping” on her preserves.

If Miriam's flirtation with the Swiss professor had been in a spirit of
frolicsomeness it would have presented at least one hopeful symptom.
But Miriam is incapable of frolicking--abnormally so. The absence of
the play impulse in her is striking, as is the lack of spontaneous
admirations or enthusiasms for people or things. Her impressions are
always in terms of sensuous attraction or repulsion--never influenced
by appeal to intellect, æsthetic taste, admiration, or ambition.
Other girls exist for her, not as kindred spirits, but as potential
rivals--even her sisters--and she is keen to size them up solely by
qualities which she senses may make them attractive to the other sex.
The exceptions to this are certain German girls whose over-sentimental
make-up furnishes easy material for Miriam's starved libido.

The next picture is at her country home where a dance has been staged,
in Miriam's own consciousness, especially as a temporary farewell
appearance of the “white twinkling figure,” now materialised into Ted.
Ted appears on programme time bringing with him a strange young man
with a German name and manner of speech, with whom she promptly goes
off spooning in a dark conservatory, where she is discovered by Ted.
She hopes the scene will stir Ted to emulation. But it does not. When
she returns to the light Ted has gone home. And that seems to be the
last of him. The strange young man is keen to announce his departure
the coming day for foreign parts. So Miriam is left to set off for her
next school without further adventures in love-making, and the reader
is left to wonder whether she is not one of the girls who are incurably
given to taking their Teds more seriously than they intend to be taken.

In “Backwater” Miriam is a teacher of little girls in a Bambury Park
school kept by three quaint refined little old English women--a
palatable contrast to the coarseness of Fraulein Pfaff--for nine
months. She is successful as a teacher, but finds her situation
unendurable and resigns. The emotional shallowness of the girls and
their lower middle-class mothers with aspirations to “get on” are
dreary, but hardly sufficiently dismal to provoke the black despair and
unreasoning rage which cause her to cry out in her moments of revolt,
“But why must I be one of those to give everything up?” There is no
masculine element connected with the school life, as there had been
with that of the German school. She contrasts herself with her sisters
who have made adaptations to life, two having become engaged and the
third having settled happily into a position as governess. But Miriam
can not settle, nor adapt. Her demon will not permit.

A girl of nineteen, brought up in middle-class culture, without
previous experiences except as teacher in two girls' schools, becomes
governess, as “Honeycomb” relates, in the country home of a Q. C.,
upon the introduction of friends of a future brother-in-law. From the
day of her arrival her wishful thinking revolves around the man of the
family. She loathes teaching the children and fails to hide from them
her boredom. By lampooning the eccentricities and stupidities of Mrs.
Corrie she betrays her hatred of women, her besetting “inferiority
complex,” which, in this instance, is partly justified by the adult
infantilism of the lady and her absorbing attachment to a woman of
questionable morality. Without anything to which to tie it on the
other side, Miriam constructs--as a spider might a web out of her own
unconscious self--a bridge of affinity between herself and the Q. C.,
placing such significance as her demon prompts upon his insignificant
words or looks, until he snubs her at dinner when she attempts to take
too leading a part in the conversation. Immediately she hates it all,
with the collapse of her bridge, and is ready to throw up her “job” and
all it implies.

Romance would seem remote from a hall bedroom in a sordid London
rooming-house and the duties of first aid to a firm of dentists. But
this is where Miriam finds it, for a time at least. The central figure
is one of the dentists in whom her autistic thoughts discover a lonely
sensitive man eager for the sympathetic understanding which Miriam is
ready to offer. The boredom of teaching gives place to ecstasy in the
discharge of the details, often repellent, which go to fill up the
“strange rich difficult day.” Her drab existence becomes a charmed
life until Miriam's libido, which has been running away with her like
a wild horse, shies right across the road at the first young girl she
sights within the orbit of the dentist. Judging from the reaction of
the latter, the explosion of jealousy and hatred that took place in
Miriam's mind must have found outward expression, for he retreats
behind a barrier of an “official tone,” which infuriates Miriam into
demanding an explanation and brings in reply to her demand a letter
from him beginning: “Dear Miss Henderson--You are very persistent”;
and concluding “foolish gossip which might end by making your position
untenable.” For the first time Miriam admits her folly, saying,

    “I have nothing now but my pained self again, having violently
    rushed at things and torn them to bits. It's all my fault from
    the very beginning.... I make people hate me by _knowing_ them
    and dashing my head against the wall of their behaviour.... I
    did not know what I had. Friendship is fine, fine porcelain.
    I have sent a crack right through it.... Mrs. Bailey (her
    landlady) ... numbers of people I never think of would like
    to have me always there.... At least I have broken up his
    confounded complacency.”

When Miriam's dingy lodging-house becomes a boarding-house new food
comes to her creative urge in the form of daily association with
masculine boarders. Her resolution in the early pages of “Interim” to
take “no more interest in men,” collapses like a house of cards upon
the first onslaught. A close companionship develops between her and
a Spanish Jew of more than unconventional ideas and habits. But her
special devil is soon busy again, and Miriam discovers romance in the
presence in the house of a young Canadian who is studying in London.
When he comes into the dining-room where Miriam is sitting with other
boarders after dinner, and sits down with his books to study:

    “He did not see that she was astonished at his coming nor her
    still deeper astonishment in the discovery of her unconscious
    certainty that he would come. A haunting familiar sense of
    unreality possessed her. Once more she was part of a novel; it
    was right, true like a book for Dr. Heber to come in in defiance
    of every one, bringing his studies into the public room in order
    to sit down quietly opposite this fair young English girl. He
    saw her apparently gravely studious and felt he could 'pursue
    his own studies' all the better for her presence.... Perhaps if
    he remained steadily like that in her life she could grow into
    some semblance of his steady reverent observation. He did not
    miss any movement or change of expression.... It _was_ glorious
    to have a real, simple homage coming from a man who was no
    simpleton, coming simple, strong and kindly from Canada to put
    you in a shrine....”

And yet all he does is to look at her! She goes for a walk and

    “the hushed happiness that had begun in the dining-room half an
    hour ago seized her again suddenly, sending her forward almost
    on tiptoe. It was securely there; the vista it opened growing in
    beauty as she walked; bearing within her in secret unfathomable
    abundance the gift of ideal old-English rose and white gracious
    adorable womanhood given her by Dr. Heber.”

When he goes to church she interprets it as a symptom of falling in
love, but if it is, the further progress of the disease is along
lines which would baffle even those who have specialised in the study
of the malady in fiction and poetry through ages. He goes back to
Canada, along with his companion students, without saying a word to his
fellow-boarder and leaves to the landlady the difficult task of warning
Miriam that her association with the Spanish Jew has furnished a
subject of gossip in the house, and that another boarder has confided
to her that Dr. Heber had “made up his mind to speak,” but that he had
been scared by Miriam's flirtation with the little Jew.

Miriam never questions the correctness of the landlady's diagnosis, nor
the authenticity of her information. Still less does she doubt her own
interpretation of the wholesome direct-minded Canadian's silent looks
in her direction.

Finally a man comes into her life who literally proposes marriage.
He is a young Russian Jew student, small of stature and suggestive
of an uncanny oldness. Under his influence she begins translating
stories from the German and seems to find some of the beneficial
possibilities of “sublimation” in the task. The test is not a true
one, however, because this little stream into which the current of her
libido is temporarily turned is too closely associated with the main
channel--Shatov--and when she becomes engaged to him the translation
seems to be forgotten.

“Deadlock” is the conflict between instinct and taste, involved in
marrying a man with whom she is in love but who arouses a revolt of her
inherited traditions and intellectual and æsthetic biases; or between
her ego instinct and her herd instinct. There the reader takes leave of
her at the end of the sixth volume.

A far more serious deadlock than that presented by her engagement is
the deadlock imposed upon Miriam by nature in creating her a woman and
endowing her with qualities which keep her in a state of revolt against
her Creator and against what to her is the indignity of being a woman.
This is epitomised splendidly in “The Tunnel,” when she is fretting her
mind through the wearying summer days to keep pace with the illness
that is creeping upon her. Entries in the dentists' index under the
word “Woman” start the train of thought:

    “inferior; mentally, morally, intellectually and physically
    ... her development arrested in the interest of her special
    functions ... reverting later towards the male type ... old
    women with deep voices and hair on their faces ... leaving off
    where boys of eighteen began.... Woman is undeveloped man ... if
    one could die of the loathsome visions.... Sacred functions ...
    highest possibilities ... sacred for what? The hand that rocks
    the cradle rules the world? The future of the race? What world?
    What race? Men.... Nothing but men; forever.... It will go on
    as long as women are stupid enough to go on bringing men into
    the world ... even if civilised women stop the colonials and
    primitive races would go on. It was a nightmare. They despise
    women and they want to go on living--to reproduce--themselves.
    None of their achievements, no 'civilisation,' no art, no
    science can redeem that. There is no possible pardon for men.
    The only answer to them is suicide; all women ought to agree to
    commit suicide.... All the achievements of men were poisoned at
    the root. The beauty of nature was tricky femininity. The animal
    world was cruelty. Jests and amusements were tragic distractions
    from tragedy.... The woman in black works. It's only in the
    evenings she can roam about seeing nothing. But the people she
    works for know nothing about her. She knows. She is sweeter than
    he. She is sweet. I like her. But he is more me.”

Earlier, but less consciously, she expresses it when, watching the men
guests at the Corrie's,

    “Miriam's stricken eyes sought their foreheads for relief.
    Smooth brows and neatly brushed hair above; but the smooth
    motionless brows were ramparts of hate; pure murderous hate.
    That's men, she said, with a sudden flash of certainty, that's
    men as they are, when they are opposed, when they are real.
    All the rest is pretence. Her thoughts flashed forward to a
    final clear issue of opposition, with a husband. Just a cold
    blank hating forehead and neatly brushed hair above it. If a
    man doesn't understand or doesn't agree he's just a blank bony
    conceited thinking, absolutely condemning forehead, a face
    below, going on eating--and going off somewhere. Men are all
    hard angry bones; always thinking something, only one thing at
    a time and unless that is agreed to, they murder. My husband
    shan't kill me.... I'll shatter his conceited brow--_make_ him
    see ... two sides to every question ... a million sides ... no
    questions, only sides ... always changing. Men argue, think they
    prove things; their foreheads recover--cool and calm. Damn them
    all--all men.”

Few writers could have sketched Miriam Henderson without condemning her
and without inviting the condemnation of the reader. Miss Richardson
has done it. She has given us Miriam as she knows herself, without
explanation, plea, or sentence, and left us to judge for ourselves. She
does not label her. And this is probably the reason Miss Richardson's
work has found so small an audience. People demand labels. They want to
be “told.” And she does not “tell” them. She invites them to think, and
original thinking is an unpopular process.

If ten people were to read these books and write their impressions of
them, the results would be as different as were the thoughts of the ten
people. Because each result would add what the author has left out: a
judgment, or an estimate of Miriam. And this judgment would be rendered
upon the evidence, but according to the mind of the judge.

The question which everyone must decide for himself is: when such
revelations of the conscious and the unconscious are spread before
him in words and sentences, does the result constitute gibberish or
genius; is it slush or sanity; is it the sort of thing one would try
to experience; or should one struggle and pray to be spared? It may be
the highroad to dementia--this concentrating of all one's thoughts upon
oneself, and oneself upon a single instinct. And Miriam might well have
been headed for it when she failed to differentiate between ideas based
upon objective evidence and ideas created solely out of her instinctive
craving, which is an approach toward the belief of the insane person in
his own delusions.

We identify ourselves, motives, and conduct with the characters of
fiction who cut a good figure; we identify with the ones who do not,
those we dislike, disdain, or condemn. Has anyone identified himself
with Miriam Henderson and added to his or her stature?

The strongest impression made upon an admirer of Miss Richardson's
craftsmanship is a wish that it might be applied to the study of a
different, a more normal, type of personality. But the wish that such
a study might be given us is burdened with a strong doubt whether its
fulfillment would be humanly possible. Could anyone but an extreme type
of egocentric person make such a study of himself? Could anyone whose
libido was normally divided in various channels follow its course so
graphically? And would not such division destroy the unity essential to
even so much of the novel form as Miss Richardson preserves?

Here is a deadlock for the reader: Miss Richardson's art and Miriam as
she is; or a Miriam with whom one could identify oneself as a heroine
of fiction.

The novel, according to Miss Richardson, may be compared to a
picture-puzzle in a box. Properly handled, the pieces may be made
to constitute an entity, a harmonious whole, a thing of beauty, a
portrait or a pergola, a windmill or a waterfall. The purpose of
the novel is to reveal the novelist, her intellectual possessions,
emotional reactions, her ideals, aspirations, and fulfilments, and to
describe the roads and short-cuts over which she has travelled while
accomplishing them. People and things encountered on the way do not
count for much, especially people. They are made up largely of women,
whom she dislikes, and men, whom she despises. It should be no part
of its purpose to picture situations, to describe places, to narrate
occurrences other than as media of author-revelation. Undoubtedly
it is one of the most delightful things in the world--this talking
about oneself. I have known many persons who pay others, physicians
for instance, to listen. But unless the narration is ladened with
adventure, or interlarded with humour, or spiced with raciness, it is
often boring; and reluctantly it must be admitted that when we have
ceased to admire Miss Richardson's show of art, when we no longer
thrill at her mastery of method, when we are tired of rising to the fly
of what Miss Sinclair calls her “punctilious perfection” of literary
form, she becomes tiresome. Egocentrics should have a sense of humour.
Samuel Butler thus endowed might have been assured of immortality.
Lacking that, they should have extensive contact with the world. That
is what enlivens the psychological jungle of Marcel Proust. If Henri
Amiel had had a tithe of Jean Jacques Rousseau's worldly and amatory
experiences his writings might have had great influence and a large
sale.

Miss Dorothy M. Richardson has revealed herself a finished technician.
She may be compared to a person who is ambitious to play the Chopin
Studies. She practices scales steadily for a year and then gives a
year to the Studies themselves. But when she essays to play for the
public she fails because, although she has mastered the mechanical
difficulties, she has not grasped the meaning. She reveals life without
drama and without comedy, and that such life does not exist everybody
knows.

She may have had compensation for her effort from two sources: her
imitators and her benefactors. The former are too numerous to mention,
but Mr. J. D. Beresford and Miss May Sinclair would undoubtedly admit
their indebtedness.

It is vicarious compensation, also, to be praised by one's peers and
superiors. If Dorothy M. Richardson hasn't yet had it, in the writer's
judgment she may look forward to it with confidence.




                               CHAPTER V
    MARCEL PROUST: MASTER PSYCHOLOGIST AND PILOT OF THE “VRAIE VIE”


Marcel Proust may justly be hailed as the greatest psychological
novelist of his time. He was to normal psychology what Dostoievsky
was to abnormal psychology: an unsurpassed observer, interpreter, and
recorder of men's thoughts and conduct.

It would be hazardous to attempt to estimate the place he will
eventually have in literature until the remaining volumes of “A la
Recherche du Temps Perdu,” and “Le Temps Retrouvé” are published. But
the volumes of the former that have appeared: “Du Côté de Chez Swann,”
“Á l'Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs,” “Le Côté de Guermantes,” and
“Sodome et Gomorrhe” justify the statement that with the death of
their author in November, 1922, France lost a writer whose fame will
rank with that of Balzac. It is not likely that he will ever have
a popularity comparable to Balzac or even to Bourget, Barbusse, or
several other contemporaries, for M. Proust is an author for writers.
He will never be read by the large class of novel readers who create
the market demand for novels of action and plot; nor will he appeal
to that hardly less numerous class--chiefly women--who find the
emotional novel palatable food. However, those who, like the writer,
cannot punish themselves by struggling through a detective story and
by whom the most skillfully contrived plot can be endured only if the
harassment which it causes is counterbalanced by the charm of its
literary style or its interpretation of the personality of the author
reacting to conditions more or less common to all mankind, may find
in M. Proust a novelist whom they can ill afford to ignore. And no
writer of fact or fiction today would be just to himself were he to
proceed with his art without making the acquaintance of this master
artificer and psychologist. Proust will be remembered as a pioneer
who explored the jungle of the unconscious memory, and a marvellous
interpreter of the laws governing associated memories. I doubt not his
name will be as inseparably connected with the novel of the future as
that of de Maupassant or Poe has been with the short story of the last
few decades, even while his wares will still find scant sale, save to
writers, dilettantes, professional students of letters, of form, and of
psychology.

The measure of success that was vouchsafed him came late in life. He
was fifty when the Goncourt Prize was awarded “A l'Ombre des Jeunes
Filles en Fleurs” in 1919. Until that time his writings were known to
readers of “La Nouvelle Revue Française,” to friends, and to a limited
circle whose members have an urge for the unusual, and a flair for
the picturesque in literature. Then readers began to nibble at “Du
Côté de Chez Swann,” and the more they nibbled, that is the oftener
they read it, or attempted to read it--for it is difficult even for a
cultured Frenchman--the more keenly aware did they become that they
had encountered a new force, a new sensibility in literature, and,
like appetite that comes with eating, the greater was their desire
to develop an intimacy with him. “Le Côté de Guermantes” showed that
he walked and talked, dined and wined, registered the thoughts and
interpreted the dreams of the aristocracy with the same security,
understanding, perspicacity, and clairvoyancy that he had brought to
bear on the bourgeoisie in “Du Côté de Chez Swann.” In “Sodome et
Gomorrhe” he did the impossible. He talked with frankness and with a
tone of authority of an enigmatic, inexplicable aberration of nature,
inversion of the genesic instinct, which antedates possibly by millions
of years the differentiation of man from anthropoid stock; which
has always been with us, now the patent of good form, the badge of
intellectual superiority, the hallmark of æsthetic refinement, as in
the days of Hellenic supremacy; now the stigma of sin, the scarlet
letter of infamy, the key of the bottomless pit, as today; and which
unquestionably will always continue to be with us. He divested it
of pruriency; he rescued it from pornography; he delivered it from
pathology; and at the same time he made the penologist pause and
“normal” man thoughtful.

Whether this freakishness of nature is as common as M. Proust
says, whether it bulks so large in the conduct of daily life as he
intimates, is a matter for the individual to estimate. No statistics
are available, but experienced psychiatrists and discerning pedagogues
know that a considerable proportion of mankind is so constituted. To
deny it is equivalent to acknowledging that one is immune to evidence;
to consider it a vice is to flaunt an allegation of falsehood in
the face of biology. One can imagine the shock the world would have
today if everyone told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth about his genesic instinct. If, then, it was decided to
segregate and deprive of liberty the inverted, what a strange medley
it would be of general and soldier, of prince and pauper, of priest
and parishioner, of genius and moron, of ambassador and attaché, of
poet, artist, and savant. It will mark an epoch in modern civilisation
when this strange variation from the normal shall be subject to study
by such investigators as Mendel, de Vries, Tschermak, and the host of
biologists who are slowly solving the mysteries of heredity. Meanwhile
the preparation for such work is the formation of public opinion, and
probably there is no better way to accomplish it than that adopted by
M. Proust.

So far the only one of M. Proust's books that has appeared in English
is “Du Côté de Chez Swann,” (Swann's Way), by C. K. Scott Moncrieff.
The translation itself is a work of art, and the reading public is
under profound obligation to this master stylist.

[Illustration: MARCEL PROUST IN 1890]

The narrator is M. Proust himself, but the reader who would understand
Proust must keep in mind that he has distributed his own personality
between two characters, the narrator of the story, and Swann. Those who
see Proust only in the first, or only in Swann, see but half of him.

In the overture he recalls the memories of a precocious, sentimental,
sickly childhood spent in his aunt's house in Combray, with an
indulgent mother, a sensible matter-of-fact father, an archaic
paternal grandmother, and two silly sentimental grandaunts. He
succeeds in introducing in the most incidental way M. Swann, the son
of a stockbroker, “a converted Jew and his parents and grandparents
before him,” who has successfully unlocked the door of smart and
savant society; his former mistress Odette de Crecy whom he has now
married, to the disgust of his neighbours; his daughter with whom the
narrator is to fall in love; M. Vinteuil whose sonata contains the
solvent of Swann's amatory resistance, and his daughter, a Gomorrite;
M. de Villeparisis; and M. de Charlus, who we shall see in “Sodome et
Gomorrhe” is not like other men.

The setting is in Brittany.

    “Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used
    to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year
    in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town,
    representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and
    as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak,
    sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd
    gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses,
    which a fragment of its mediæval ramparts enclosed, here and
    there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a
    little town in a primitive painting.”

He who invokes his memories is a boy of ten or thereabouts, lying in
bed and awaiting dinner to end and M. Swann to depart that his mother
may kiss him goodnight. Memory of it was like a luminous panel, sharply
defined against a vague and shading background.

    “The little parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows
    of the path along which would come M. Swann, the unconscious
    author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would journey
    to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which
    constituted, all by itself, the tapering 'elevation' of an
    irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the
    little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in
    a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all
    its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its
    shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like
    the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its
    performance in the provinces); to the drama of my undressing,
    as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by
    a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there
    but seven o'clock at night.”

The power not only of reproducing scenes and events, but also of
revivifying states of consciousness long past through invoking
associated memories, is utilised with an effect rarely parallelled
in literature. It is invoked through any of the special senses, but
chiefly through taste and hearing. The little cake soaked in tea which,
taken many years after the trivial events of his childhood at Combray
had been all but forgotten, unlocks, as if by magic, the chamber stored
with memories.

    “No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it,
    touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body,
    and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were
    taking place. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but
    individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at
    once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its
    disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory--this new sensation
    having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a
    precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was
    myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal.”

He then tries to analyse the state, and

    “that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out every
    obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit
    all attention to the sounds which come from the next room....
    Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being
    must be the image, the visual memory which, being linked to
    that taste, has tried to follow it into my conscious mind....
    Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness,
    this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an
    identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb,
    to raise up out of the very depths of my being?”

It does reach the surface of consciousness, for

    “once I had recognised the taste of the crumb of madeleine
    soaked in her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to
    give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the
    discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the
    old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up
    like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little
    pavilion, opening on to the garden.... And just as the Japanese
    amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and
    steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are
    without character or form, but, the moment they become wet,
    stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive
    shape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and
    recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden
    and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and
    the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the
    parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings,
    taking their proper shape and growing solid, sprang into being,
    town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.”

M. Proust's description of the first effect upon him of the little
“madeleine” dipped in tea, when, “weary after a dull day, with the
prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the
tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake” is almost a paraphrase
of the words of Locke in his “Essay Concerning Human Understanding.”

Music, more than anything else, has the power of invoking Swann's
associated memories. A little phrase of old Vinteuil's Sonata runs like
a fine thread all through the tangle of Swann's love for Odette de
Crecy, although the memory of the phrase goes back prior to his meeting
Odette--to the night of the party at which he had heard it, after going
home from which

    “he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for
    a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which
    strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without
    his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he
    loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her
    name.”

Swann had tried in vain to identify the fugitive phrase which had
awakened in him a passion for music that seemed to be bringing into his
life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation.

    “Like a confirmed invalid whom all of a sudden, a change of
    air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as
    sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous
    and unaccountable, seems to have so far removed from his malady
    that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all
    hope, of starting to lead--and better late than never--a wholly
    different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the
    phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he
    had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not,
    perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of
    those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but
    to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness
    from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he
    was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the
    power to consecrate his life.”

    “It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture our own past;
    all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past
    is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of
    intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that
    material object will give us) which we do not suspect. And as
    for that object, it depends on chance whether we come upon it or
    not before we ourselves must die.”

Associative memory depends upon the fact that though the grouping
of the stimuli is novel, the elementary components are individually
similar to previous stimuli, and Proust avails himself of this
established fact. These elementary stimuli leave retention traces
in the central nervous system. When the same stimuli recur in a new
grouping the pathways and centres that bear such traces are brought
into connection and are combined in new ways. This modifies the form of
the response. As the separate retention traces were due to conditions
resembling the present, the new response will tend to be adaptive. This
associative memory is known in psychology as mnemonic combination.

Although no attempt is made to describe the development of the
personality of the sensitive, sentimental, impressionable, precocious
child who narrates the story, one gets an extraordinarily vivid picture
of him. He has the hallmarks and habituations of neuropathy, and
amongst them phantasying and substitution.

    “In those days, when I read to myself, I used often, while I
    turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to
    the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more
    were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to
    me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd
    changes which take place in the relations between the miller's
    wife and the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of
    love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery,
    the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that
    strange and pleasant-sounding name of _Champi_, which draped
    the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour,
    purpurate and charming.”

That his neuropathic constitution was a direct inheritance is obvious.
He got it through his Aunt Leonie

    “who since her husband's death, had gradually declined to leave,
    first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom,
    and finally her bed; and who now never 'came down,' but lay
    perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical
    exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances....
    My aunt's life now was practically confined to two adjoining
    rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while
    they aired the other.”

Despite these apparent restrictions of life's activities she knows more
of the happenings of the village than the town crier, and in a way she
conditions the conduct of her neighbours whose first question is “What
effect will it have on Aunt Leonie?” Her contact with people is limited
to Françoise, a perfect servant, to Eulalie, a limping, energetic, deaf
spinster, and to the reverend Curé.

    “My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from
    her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her
    eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of
    people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and
    the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who
    advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached
    (even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond
    an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile) the
    subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good
    red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two
    dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours)
    than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category
    was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was
    more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as
    seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had
    allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and
    at Françoise's urgent request, and who in the course of their
    visit had shown how unworthy they were of the honour which had
    been done them by venturing a timid: 'Don't you think that if
    you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?'
    or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: 'I am very
    low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!' had replied: 'Ah,
    yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while
    yet'; each party alike might be certain that her doors would
    never open to them again.”

[Illustration: A PAGE OF CORRECTED PROOF SHOWING MARCEL PROUST'S METHOD
OF REVISION]

With all his literary art, and mastery of the mysterious powers that
suggestion has to heighten awareness and deepen information, M. Proust
does not succeed in enlightening us as to how the boy at Combray
comes to possess so much information of people and such knowledge of
the world. Part of it is intuitive, but understanding of Vinteuil's
daughter, who “after a certain year we never saw alone, but always
accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil
reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself
permanently at Montjouvain,” thus leading M. Vinteuil broken-hearted
to the grave because of the shame and scandal of her sadism, is beyond
possibility even for a boy of his precocity and prehensibility.

    “For a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must have been
    far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to
    have to resign himself to one of those situations which are
    wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they
    are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the
    security necessary to its development a vice which Nature
    herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more
    than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she
    might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M.
    Vinteuil may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not
    follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of
    life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are
    cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs,
    so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them
    continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening
    them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one
    after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family,
    will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or
    the capacity of its physician.”

Thus does he introduce most casually a subject which bulks large in
“Sodome et Gomorrhe,” and which M. Proust understands like a composite
priest, physician, and biologist.

Most of the grist of the boy's mill comes over the road that skirts
Swann's park, but some comes the Guermantes Way. In “Le Côté de
Guermantes,” which followed “A l'Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs,”
he makes us as intimately acquainted with the Duchesse de Guermantes,
Mme. de Villeparisis, and other notables of the _société élegante_, as
he does in “Swann's Way” with the Verdurins and their “little nucleus”
which furnishes a background to Odette, and furnishes M. Proust with
canvas upon which to paint the portrait of an Æsculapian bounder, Dr.
Cottard, who, it has been said, is still of the quick. M. Proust was
the son and the brother of a physician and had abundant opportunity
not only to get first-hand information but to have his natural insight
quickened. In the same way one discovers his Jewish strain (his mother
was a Jewess) in his mystic trends and in his characters such as Bloch
and Swann. “Whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my
friends and brought him home with me that friend was invariably a Jew.”
Moreover his lack of a sense of humour is an Hebraic trait. With the
exception of the reaction provoked in his grandfather by the advent
of one of these friends, “Swann's Way,” and indeed all M. Proust's
writings, are humourless.

The genesis of Swann's love and the dissolution of Odette's take up one
volume. If it is not a perfect description of the divine passion in a
mature man surfeited by conquest and satiated by indulgence, it is an
approximation to it.

He was introduced one day at the theatre to Odette de Crocy by an old
friend of his, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature
with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding. She made no
appeal to Swann; indeed she not only left him indifferent, aroused in
him no desire, but gave him a sort of physical repulsion. But Odette
knew the _ars amandi_ as did Circe or Sappho, and ere long she had
entangled him in the meshes of Eros' net. When the net was drawn to
her craft and the haul examined, it didn't interest her, though she
kept it, for it contributed to her material welfare. Then M. Proust
did a psychological stunt which reveals an important aspect of his
mastery of the science. Swann identified Odette with Zipporah, Jethro's
daughter, whose picture is to be seen in one of the Sixtine frescoes by
Botticelli. Her similarity to it enhanced her beauty and rendered her
more precious in his sight. Moreover it enabled him to introduce the
image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies where she assumed a
new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh,
by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face,
her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his
love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that
he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his
æsthetic principles. Instead of placing a photograph of Odette on his
study table, he placed one of Jethro's daughter, and on it he lavished
his admiration and concentrated his intensity in all the abandon of
substitution.

The author utilises the potency of suspense to bring Swann's ardour to
the boiling point. One evening when Odette had avoided him he searched
the restaurants of the Boulevards in a state of increasing panic.

    “Among all the methods by which love is brought into being,
    among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there
    are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now
    and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in
    whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot
    is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom
    we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should
    have pleased us up till then, any more, or even as much as
    others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should
    become exclusive.”

He proceeded to cultivate his love in an emotional medium and to
inoculate himself with the culture which rendered him immune to
love of another. The culture medium was furnished by Vinteuil, the
old composer, who had died of a broken heart. “He would make Odette
play him the phrase from the sonata again ten, twenty times on end,
insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him.”

    “Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one
    would have said that he was inhaling an anæsthetic which allowed
    him to breathe more deeply.”

The effect that it had was deep repose, mysterious refreshment.
He felt himself transformed into a “creature foreign to humanity,
blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn,
a chimera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears
alone.”

Swann's discovery of the spiritual and bodily inconstancies of his
mistress, the perfidies and betrayals of the Verdurins, his jealousy,
planned resentments, and resurrection are related in a way that
convinces us that Proust saw life steadily and saw it whole.

To appease his anguish, to thwart his obsession, to supplant his
preoccupation he decided to frequent again the aristocratic circles
he had forsaken. The description of the reception at Mme. de Saint
Euverte's, showing the details of fashionable life, is of itself a
noteworthy piece of writing. Not only is it replete with accurate
knowledge of such society, but it gives M. Proust the opportunity
to display understanding of motives and frailties and to record
impressions of contact with the world abroad. Speaking of one of the
guests he says:

    “She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human
    race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels
    about people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing
    interest in the people whom it does.”

The peculiar tendency which Swann always had to look for analogies
between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself
here in a more positive and more general form. One of the footmen
was not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which
represent executions, tortures, and the like. Another reminded him of
the decorative warriors one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's
paintings. “He seemed as determined to remain as unconcerned as if he
had been present at the massacre of the innocents or the martyrdom
of St. James.” As he entered the salon one reminded him of Giotto's
models, another of Albert Dürer's, another of that Greek sculpture
which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, while a servant with a
pallid countenance and a small pig-tail clubbed at the back of his head
seemed like one of Goya's sacristans.

It was this soirée that conditioned irrevocably Swann's future life,
and the little phrase from Vinteuil's Sonata did it for him. To have
heard it “in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no
one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely
absent” made him suffer insupportably. While listening to it

    “suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition
    tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his
    heart.... All his memories of the days when Odette had been in
    love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in
    keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this
    sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed,
    had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken
    wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for
    his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness.”

It raised the flood-gate of the dam in which he had stored the
memories of Odette when she loved him and before he loved her. Not
only did it liberate the memories of her, but the memories that were
associated with them: all the net-work of mental habits, of seasonable
impressions, of sensory reactions, through which it extended over a
series of groups its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself
inextricably held.

    “When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had
    the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to
    disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like
    a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had
    observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between
    the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition
    of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a
    contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing
    this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon
    certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience)
    for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before
    ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the
    first time he had heard the sonata played....

    “In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye
    a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so
    consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so
    original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the
    memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would
    repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness....

    “Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it
    existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other
    conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions
    of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the
    rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified
    and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be
    obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as
    we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which
    we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any
    material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity
    of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed
    aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even
    the memory of the darkness....

    “So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the
    sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of
    view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural
    creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that,
    we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the
    unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that
    divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment
    in the firmament of ours.”

From that evening Swann understood that the feeling which Odette
had once had for him would never revive. He had made his bed, and
he resolved to share it in holy matrimony with Odette, though this
discomforted his friends and made him a species of Pariah.

Mme. Swann in Combray was a solitary, but not in Paris. There she
queened it, as many lovely ladies had done before her. The account of
that, and of the narrator's love for Gilberte, Swann's daughter, who,
when he had encountered her casually at Combray, had made a stirring
and deep impression on him; and the advent of Albertine, a potential
Gomorrite, make up the contents of the succeeding instalment, entitled
“A l'Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs.” Gilberte, Swann's daughter,
and the narrator now approaching puberty, came to play together in the
Champs Elysées, frolicking like children, innocently, though another
feeling began soon to bud in him, a feeling which he did not yet
understand. In this volume the narrator relates the experiences he had
when a youth, and therefore there is more precision in the description
of the persons with whom he came in contact. The volume also throws
much light indirectly on Proust's personality. From a certain incident
which he tells regarding the way he was brought up, one sees that
his father was a rigourous aristocrat, stiff in his demeanour, and
very particular in the choice of his connections. He, the narrator,
was brought up in a way the Germans would call “schablonenmässig”:
everything was discussed at a family council, as though he were an
inanimate plaything. His naïvete, the result of such training, is very
characteristic.

For some time he had been longing to see “Phèdre” played by the famous
Mme. La Berma (evidently Sarah Bernhardt, for at that time she was the
only one who played “Phèdre”). After long deliberation because of his
illness, it was decided he should go chaperoned by his grandmother,
to see his ideal actress. The scene opened with two men who rushed
on in the throes of heated argument. He did not know that this was
part of the play and that the men were actors; he thought they were
some ruffians who had forced their way into the theatre and who would
surely be ejected by the officials. He wondered, though, that the
spectators not only did not protest, but listened to them with the
greatest attention. Only when the theatre re-echoed with applause did
he understand that the two men were actors. Afterwards, when two ladies
came upon the stage, both of portly bearing, he could not decide which
one was La Berma; a little later he learned that neither of them was
the great actress. To reconcile such unsophistication with the account
of the peeping Tom episode when he laid bare Mlle. Vinteuil's deforming
habituation is very difficult.

Swann, now ill, and repentant, was consumed with ambition to introduce
his wife, Odette, into high society, in which he succeeded to a great
extent. Though he did not like M. Buntemps because of his reactionary
opinions, he, “the director of the minister's office,” was an important
personage and his wife, Mme. Buntemps, was a steady visitor in Odette's
salon. But once in a while he was malicious enough to exasperate
Mme. Buntemps. He told her once he would invite the Cottards and the
Duchesse de Vendome to dinner. Mme. Buntemps protested, saying it was
not seemly that the Cottards should be at the same table with the
Duchesse. In reality she was jealous of the Cottards who were going to
share the honour with her. The Prince d'Agrigente was invited, because
it was altogether “private”! Odette is described as a woman of low
intelligence, without education, speaking faulty French, but shrewd,
dominating her husband. One of her guests was Mme. Cottard, the wife
of Dr. Cottard, the medical bounder who had now become Professor, a
woman who did not belong to her present circle. But she had to invite a
person who could tell her former friends of her high connections, so as
to raise their envy.

The Marquis de Norpais, a former ambassador, is admirably drawn. He was
naturally considered by the narrator's father as the cream of society.
Just think of it! a man with two titles: Monsieur l'Ambassadeur,
and Son Excellence Monsieur le Marquis! It is true that he was an
ambassador under a republican government. But because of this he was
interesting, for despite his antecedents he was entrusted with several
extraordinary missions by very radical ministers. When a monarchist
would not accept that honour, the republican government having had no
fear that he might betray it, M. de Norpais himself willingly accepted
the charge. Being in his blood a diplomat, he could not help exercising
the functions of a diplomat, though in his heart he detested the
republican spirit of government.

The narrator's mother did not admire his intelligence, but for the
father every word of M. l'Ambassadeur de Norpais was an oracle. He had
always wished that his son should become a diplomat, while the son
wished to take up literature so as not to be separated from Gilberte.
M. de Norpais, who did not much like the new style diplomats, told the
narrator's father that a writer could gain as much consideration and
more independence than a diplomat. His father changed his mind.

It is quite impossible, within the space of an essay, to give even an
outline of the remaining volumes that have already appeared of this
amazing and epochal novel.

Without doubt M. Proust had a definite idea in mind, a determination to
make a contribution: to prove that the dominant force in mental life
is association, the chief resource of mentality reminiscence. Thus the
primitive instincts of mankind and their efforts to obtain convention's
approbation furnish the material with which he has built. It is
extraordinary how large association bulks: individuals remind him of
famous paintings, not merely the general characters of the people whom
he encounters in his daily life, but rather what seem least susceptible
of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he
knows. For instance, a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo,
is suggested by the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in
short a speaking likeness to his own coachman Rami; the colouring of a
Ghirlandajo, by the nose of M. de Palancy; a portrait by Tintoretto, by
the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker,
the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du
Bolbon.

If, on descending the stairs after one of the Doncières evenings,
suddenly on arriving in the street, the misty night and the lights
shining through suggest a time when he arrived at Combray, at once
there is thrown on the screen of his consciousness a picture of
incidents there and experiences elsewhere that are as vivid and as
distinct as if he were looking at them on a moving-picture screen. Then
suddenly there appears a legend “the useless years which slipped by
before my invisible vocation declared itself, that invisible vocation
of which this work is the history.” Like the monk who seeks God in
solitude, like Nietzsche who sought Him in reason, M. Proust has sought
to reveal his soul, his personality, the sum total of all his various
forms of consciousness by getting memory to disgorge her contents, the
key to the chamber being association.

    “We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account,
    the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them;
    we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves
    barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds,
    to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all
    our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence
    and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are
    situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them.”

There are so many features of M. Proust's work that excite admiration
that it is possible to enumerate only a few. Despite a studied style
of confusion and interminable sentences, suspended, hyphenated,
alembicated, and syncopated, that must forever make him the despair
of anyone whose knowledge of French is not both fundamental and
colloquial, he makes telling, life-like pen pictures of things and
persons. Such is one of Françoise, the maid at Combray,

    “who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her
    kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed
    to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for church-going;
    who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse,
    whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the
    appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids
    who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring
    them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a
    household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,
    doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him
    and show him no special attention, knowing very well that they
    have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to
    the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on
    the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and
    mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and
    do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish
    affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often
    conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of
    training can produce the least trace of individuality.

    “The daughter of Françoise, on the contrary, spoke, thinking
    herself a woman of today and freed from all customs, the
    Parisian argot and did not miss one of the jokes belonging to
    it. Françoise having told her that I had come from a Princess:
    'Ah, doubtless a Princess of the cocoanut.' Seeing that I
    was expecting a visitor, she pretended to think that I was
    called Charles. I answered 'No,' naïvely, which permitted
    her to exclaim 'Ah, I thought so! And I was saying to myself
    Charles waits (charlatan).' It wasn't very good taste, but I
    was less indifferent when as a consolation for the tardiness
    of Albertine, she said, 'I think you can wait for her in
    perpetuity. She will not come any more.' Ah, our gigolettes of
    today!

    “Thus her conversation differed from that of her mother but what
    is more curious the manner of speaking of her mother was not the
    same as that of her grandmother, a native of Bailleau-le-Pin
    which was near the country of Françoise. However the patois were
    slightly different, like the two country places. The country
    of the mother of Françoise was made up of hills descending
    into a ravine full of willows. And, very far from there, on
    the contrary, there was in France a little region where one
    spoke almost exactly the same patois as at Meseglise. I made
    the discovery at the same time that I was bored by it. In fact,
    I once found Françoise talking fluently with a chambermaid of
    the house who came from the country and spoke its patois. They
    understood each other mostly. I did not understand them at
    all. They knew this but did not stop on this account, excused,
    so they thought, by the joy of being compatriots, although
    born so far apart, for continuing to speak before me this
    foreign language as if they did not wish to be understood. This
    picturesque study of linguistic geography and comradeship was
    followed each week in the kitchen without my taking any pleasure
    in it.”

Time, M. Proust was convinced, was made for slaves. It takes longer
to read his account of a soirée at the Prince de Guermantes' than
it would to attend it. It requires half a volume to narrate it. The
account is masterly, and the reader is filled with the feelings that
actual experience might produce. Those who have had contact with
aristocracy, and whose lucidity of mind has not been impaired by it,
also find such an account interesting. Here one meets aristocrats of
every complexion, heirs of the oldest and proudest names in Gotha's
Almanach, and those whose pedigree is not so ancient, upon whom the
former look condescendingly. As in a Zoo, one sees a great variety
of the aristocrat genus, and if one has believed that the nobility
is formed of people different and better than the common herd the
delusion is dissipated. Here is a light that fairly dazzles those who
are susceptible to the appeal of clothes, wealth, and jewels. If one's
yearnings are for things more substantial in human nature he will not
be satisfied as a guest of the Prince de Guermantes. Diogenes there
would have used his lantern in vain.

One becomes intimately acquainted with the _haut monde_, their colossal
pride, and overweening conceit, concealed from the eyes of those
below them in the hierarchy by thin veils of conventional and shallow
amiability which they make more and more transparent as the people
they deal with are further removed from the blue zone of the _nobilior
spectrum_. One discovers also another characteristic: the capacity for
putting up with such pride and conceit from above, and for making the
best of it for the sake of securing the lustre which comes with the
good will of those higher up, and contact with them.

In the society of the Guermantes one becomes acquainted with such
specimens of human meanness and hatefulness, such hypocrisy, such
paucity of the sentiments that ennoble life, that he finds himself
wondering why better flowers do not grow in the enchanted gardens.
Those which seemed so beautiful at a distance turn out to be not only
without fragrance, but with a bad odour. The _grand monde_, in truth,
seems to be nothing but a small world of gossiping and shallow talk,
a world aware of no other nobility than that of inherited titles, and
scorning the idea that real nobility is a refinement of the soul,
produced by education, to which rich and poor, high and low, may all
aspire. The feeling of a man not recognised as an aristocrat who,
for some special reason, gains admission to this circle, is made
vivid in the experience of a talented physician who has saved the
life of the Prince de Guermantes and who owes his invitation to the
reception to the Prince's gratitude. The experience of a Bavarian
musician is also interesting. It shows how great can be the insolence
of aristocracy swollen with vanity. At the soirée we meet nobles who
never possessed ideals which acted as armour against pollution, nobles
with imaginations easily inflamed by the attractions of women servants,
whose lust for a chambermaid is sufficient to dim all consciousness
of their pedigrees. And we meet others who are even lower, noblemen
and ladies who keep up the traditions of Sodom and Gomorrah in modern
society.

It may be beside the question to inquire the intention of the author
in painting this picture of high society and then dwelling on aspects
of it that can only cause disgust. His words at times seem to reveal
a sarcastic intention. His descriptions are so full of minute details
and so rich in incidents of extreme naturalness that it is impossible
to believe that even a lively imagination could fabricate them. One
easily sees that they are fragments of real life. This keeps the
interest alive, despite the involved style. His periods are so twisted
and turgid with associated thoughts, so bristling with parenthetical
clauses that often profound effort is required to interpret them.
There is none of the plain, clear, sane, sunny style of a Daudet,
or of Paul Bourget. This causes a sensation of discomfort at times,
especially when the author indulges in introspection that reveals a
morbid imagination and pathological sensitiveness; as, for instance, in
the distinction between abiding sorrows and fugitive sorrows; on how
our beloved departed ones live in us, act on us, transform us even more
than the living ones; and how those who are dead grow to be more real
to us who love them than when they were alive.

We feel an unhealthiness under it all. We have to stop and analyse, to
unravel the main idea from the tangled skein in which it is hidden.
But it is a work that brings its own reward. It brings real jewels of
_finesse de pensée et d'observation_, such as those on the reminiscence
of departed sensations and feelings; on the different selves which we
have been in the past and which coexist in our present individuality;
on the eclipses to which the latter is subject when one of its
components suddenly steps from the dark recesses into the vivid light
of consciousness; on the elements of beauty apparent in different
individuals who are partial incarnations of one great beauty without;
on reminiscence of Plato; on the anxiety of expectation while awaiting
a person; on the effect which consciousness of his own sinfulness has
on the sinner; on the interchange of moral qualities and idiosyncrasies
of persons bound by mutual sympathy; on the permanence of our
passions--in mathematical jargon, a function of the time during which
they have acted on our spirit. It also discloses treasures of delicate
feeling, such as are awakened in a person by the image of a beloved one
that flashes vivid in his memory.

But to discover such treasures one has often to wade through a series
of long and indigestible sentences of thirty or forty lines.

I recall reading in an English magazine, a number of years ago,
an article entitled “A Law in Literary Expression.” Stated in its
plainest terms, the law is this: that the length of the phrase--not the
sentence, but its shortest fraction, the phrase--must be measured by
the breath pause. M. Proust breaks this law oftener than any citizen of
this country breaks the prohibition law, no matter how imperious may be
his thirst.

Finally the frank and scientific way in which he has discussed a
subject that has always been tabooed in secular literature calls for
remark. Of the posterity of Sodom he says it forms a colony spread all
over the world, and that one can count it as one can count the dust of
the earth. He studies all the types and varieties of sodomists. Their
manners and ways, their sentiments, their aberrations of the senses,
their shame are passed in review. It is a sort of scientific, poetical
treatise. The actions in which the sodomistic instinct finds its outlet
are often compared to the seemingly conscious actions by which flowers
attract the insects that are the instruments of their fecundation.
Botany and sexuality are mixed together. Sometimes the scientific
spirit, gaining the upper hand, leads him to look upon these phenomena
of genesic inversion as manifestations of a natural law, and therefore
marvellous, like all the workings of nature. He is nearly carried away,
and finds excuses for what is considered a vice, and seems to be on the
verge almost of expressing his admiration.

Some of his observations on sodomistic psychology are highly
interesting, although expressed in long periods.

I append a few pages of literal translation from the opening chapter
of “Sodome et Gomorrhe”; first, that the reader may have a sample
of M. Proust's style; second, that he may gain an insight of the
grasp the writer has of one of nature's most unsolvable riddles; and
finally, that he may have the description of an individual who plays an
important part in the novel.

    “At the beginning of this scene, before my unsealed eyes, a
    revolution had taken place in M. de Charlus, as complete, as
    immediate as if he had been touched by a magic wand. Until
    then, not understanding, I had not seen. The vice (so-called
    for convenience), the vice of each individual, accompanies him
    after the manner of those genii who are invisible to those who
    ignore their presence. Goodness, deceit, a good name, social
    relations do not allow themselves to be discovered, they exist
    hidden. Ulysses himself did not at first recognise Athene. But
    gods are immediately perceptible to gods, the like to the like,
    so M. de Charlus was to Julien. Until now, in the presence of
    M. de Charlus, I was like an absent-minded man in company with
    a pregnant woman, whose heavy figure he had not remarked and
    of whom, in spite of her smiling reiteration 'Yes, I am a bit
    tired just now,' he persists in asking indiscreetly, 'What is
    the matter with you then?' But, let some one say to him, 'She
    is pregnant,' he immediately is conscious of her abdomen and
    hereafter sees nothing but that. Enlightenment opens the eyes;
    an error dissipated gives an added sense.

    “Those persons who do not like to believe themselves examples of
    this law in others--towards the Messieurs de Charlus of their
    acquaintance whom they did not suspect even until there appears
    on the smooth surface of a character, apparently in every
    respect like others, traced in an ink until then invisible,
    a word dear to the ancient Greeks, have only to recall, in
    order to satisfy themselves, how at first the surrounding world
    appeared naked, devoid of those ornamentations which it offers
    to the more sophisticated, and also, of the many times in their
    lives that they had been on the point of making a break. For
    instance, nothing upon the characterless face of some man could
    make them suppose that he was the brother, the fiancé or the
    lover of some woman of whom they are on the point of making an
    uncomplimentary remark, as, for example, to compare her to a
    camel. At that moment, fortunately, however, some word whispered
    to him by a neighbour freezes the fatal term on his lips. Then
    immediately appears, like a _Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin_, these
    words, 'This is the fiancé, or the brother, or the lover of the
    woman, therefore it would be impossible to call her a camel
    before him,' and, this new notion alone causes the retreat or
    advance of the fraction of those notions, heretofore completed,
    that he had had concerning the rest of the family.

    “The real reason that M. de Charlus was different from other men
    was because another being had been engrafted upon him, like the
    horse upon the centaur, that his being was incorporated with
    that of the Baron. I had not hitherto perceived. The abstract
    had not become materialised, the being, finally understood had
    lost its power of remaining invisible, and the transmutation of
    M. de Charlus into a new person was so complete that not only
    the contrasts of his face, of his voice, but retrospectively
    the heights and depths of his relations with me, everything,
    in fact, which had until then appeared incoherent, became
    intelligible, disclosed itself, like a phrase which, without
    meaning so long as the letters composing it are scattered
    becomes, if the characters be placed in their proper order, a
    thought impossible to forget.

    “Moreover I now understood why, a short time ago, when I saw
    M. de Charlus coming out from Mme. de Villeparisis' I thought
    he looked like a woman. It was because he was one! He belonged
    to that race of beings whose ideal is virile because their
    temperament is feminine, and who are, in appearance only, like
    other men. The silhouette cast in the facet of their eyes,
    through which they see everything in the universe, is not that
    of a nymph but of a beautiful young man. One of a race upon
    whom rests a curse, who is forced to live in an atmosphere of
    falsehood and perjury because he knows that his desire, that
    which gives to all creatures the greatest satisfaction in life,
    must be unavowed, being considered punishable and shameful, who
    must even deny God himself, since when even as a Christian he
    appears as an accused at the bar of the tribunal he must before
    Christ and in his name defend himself as if from a calumny from
    that which is his very life; son without a mother, forced to lie
    to her all her life, even to the moment when he is closing her
    eyes, friend without friendships, in spite of all those who are
    attracted by his charm, fully recognised, and whose hearts would
    lead them to be kind--for can those relations, which bloom only
    by favour of a lie, be called friendship, when the first burst
    of confidence he might be tempted to express, would cause him to
    be rejected with disgust? Should he, by chance, have to do with
    an impartial mind, that is to say a sympathetic one, even then
    diverted from him by a psychology of convention, would permit
    to flow from the confessed vice even the affection which is the
    most foreign to him--as certain judges extenuate and excuse more
    easily assassination amongst inverts and treason amongst Jews
    from reasons drawn from original sin and fatality of race.

    “Finally, lovers (at least according to the first theory
    advanced which one will see modified by the continuation and
    which would have angered them above everything had not this
    contradiction been wiped out from before their eyes by the same
    illusion that made them see and live) to whom the possibility
    of this love (the hope of which gives them the force to bear so
    many risks, so much solitude) is nearly closed since they are
    naturally attracted to a man who does not resemble in any way a
    woman, a man who is not an invert and who therefore cannot love
    them; consequently their desire would remain forever unappeased
    if money did not deliver to them real men or if the imagination
    did not cause them to take for real men the inverts to whom
    they are prostituted. Whose only honour is precarious; whose
    only liberty provisory, up to the discovery of the crime; whose
    only situation is unstable like the poet, who, fêted at night
    in all the salons, applauded in all the theatres of London
    is chased from his lodgings in the morning and can find no
    place to lay his head. Turning the treadmill like Sampson and
    saying like him, 'The two sexes will die each on his own side.'
    Excluded even (except during the days of great misfortune
    when the greatest number rallies around the victim like the
    Jews around Dreyfus--from the sympathy--sometimes of society)
    excluded even from their kind who see with disgust, reflected
    as in a mirror which no longer flatters, all those blemishes
    which they have not been willing to see in themselves and which
    make them understand that that which they call their love (and
    to which, playing upon the word, they have annexed everything
    that poetry, painting, music, chivalry, asceticism can add to
    love) comes not from an ideal of beauty which they have chosen,
    but from an incurable malady. Like the Jews again (save a few
    who only care to consort with their own race and have always
    on the lips ritualistic words and consecrated pleasantries);
    they fly from each other, seeking those who are most unlike
    them, who will have nothing to do with them, pardoning their
    rebuffs, intoxicating themselves with their condescensions; but
    also reassembled with their kind by the very ostracism which
    strikes them, the opprobrium into which they have fallen, and
    finally taking on (as a result of a persecution similar to that
    of Israel) the physical and moral characteristics of a race,
    sometimes beautiful, often frightful, finding (in spite of all
    the mockeries that those more homogeneous, better assimilated
    to the other race, in appearance less of an invert heap upon
    him who is apparently more of one) finding even a kind of
    expansion in frequenting with their kind, even an aid from
    their existence so that while denying that they belong to that
    race (whose very name is the greatest of injuries) those who
    have succeeded in hiding the truth, that they also are of that
    despised race, unmask those others, less to injure them, not
    detesting them, than to excuse themselves, as a physician seeks
    the appendicitis inversion in history, they find pleasure in
    recalling that Socrates was one of them and that the same thing
    was said of Jesus by the Israelites, without remembering that
    then when homo-sexuality was normal there was no abnormality,
    as there were no anti-Christians before Christ, also that
    opprobrium alone makes it crime, since it has been only allowed
    to exist as crime because it is refractory to all predication,
    all example, to all punishment by virtue of special innate
    disposition which repulses men more (although it may accompany
    high moral qualities) than certain vices which contradict high
    moral qualities, such as theft, cruelty, bad faith, better
    understood, therefore more easily excused by men in general.

    “Forming a free-masonry, much more extended, more efficacious
    and less suspected than that of the lodges, because it rests
    upon an identity of tastes, of needs, of habits, of dangers, of
    apprenticeships, of knowledge, of traffic and of language. Whose
    members avoid one another and yet immediately recognise each
    other by natural or conventional signs, involuntary or studied,
    which disclose to the mendicant one of his kind in the lord
    whose carriage door he opens, to the father in the fiancé of his
    daughter, to him who had wished to be cured, to confess, in the
    physician, the priest or the lawyer whom he had gone to consult;
    all obliged to protect their secret, but, at the same time,
    sharing the secret of the others, which was not suspected by the
    others and which makes the most improbable romances of adventure
    seem true to them, for, in their romantic life, anachronically,
    the ambassador is the friend of the criminal, the prince who,
    with a certain freedom of manner, (which an aristocratic
    education gives and which would be impossible with a little
    trembling bourgeois) leaves the house of the duchess to seek the
    Apache. Rejected part of the human collectivity but all the same
    an important part, suspected where it does not exist, vaunting
    itself, insolently with impunity where it is not divined;
    counting its adherents everywhere, amongst the people, in the
    army, in the temple, in the prison, upon the throne; finally
    living, at least a great number of them, in a caressing and
    dangerous intimacy with men of the other race, provoking them,
    enticing them to speak of this vice as if it were not theirs, a
    game which is made easy by the blindness or the falseness of the
    others, a game which may be prolonged for years--until the day
    of Scandal, when these conquerors are devoured. Until this time
    obliged to hide their true life, to turn away their regards from
    where they would wish to fix them, to fix them upon that from
    which they would naturally turn away--to change the meaning of
    many adjectives in their vocabulary, a social constraint merely,
    slight compared to that interior constraint which their vice, or
    that which is improperly called so, imposes upon them, less with
    regard to others than to themselves and in a manner which makes
    it seem not to be a vice--to themselves. But certain ones, more
    practical, more hurried, who have not time to bargain and to
    renounce the simplification of life and the gain of time that
    might result from cooperation, have made two societies, of which
    the second is exclusively composed of beings like themselves.”

M. Proust's work is the first definite reply in the affirmative to the
question whether fiction can subsist without the seductive power due
to a certain illusory essence of thought. Whether in this respect he
will have many, if any, successful followers is to be seen. But his
own volumes stand as an astonishing example of an organic and living
fiction obtained solely by the effort to portray truth.

Because of the unique qualities of his novels and the fact that they
are developed on a definite psychological plan, more than the usual
interest in a favourite writer is attached to the personality of M.
Proust. During his lifetime inaccessible both because of aristocratic
taste and of partial invalidism, his figure is likely to become more
familiar to the reading world--even to those who never read his
books--than the figures of great authors who walked with the crowd and
kept the common touch.

Neither Proust the man nor Proust the author can be considered apart
from his invalidism. It shows all through his writings, although
what the malady was which rendered him, if not a _de facto_ invalid,
certainly a potential invalid, is not known. Some of his friends
accused asthma, others a disease of the heart, while still others
attributed it to “nerves.” In reality his conduct and his writings were
consistent with neuropathy and his heredity. And if the hero of “A
la Recherche du Temps Perdu” is to be identified with himself, as is
popularly supposed, he was from early childhood delicate, sensitive,
precocious, and asthmatic, that is profoundly neuropathic.

He was fastidious in his tastes; he liked the best styles, the most
elegant ladies, aristocratic salons, and fashionable gatherings. He was
noted for the generosity of his tips. His life reminds one of the hero
of Huysman's famous novel. In his early days, M. Proust was a great
swell, and there is no doubt that many of his descriptions of incidents
and persons are elaborations of notes that he made after attending a
reception given by the Duchesse de Rohan, or other notables of the
Faubourg St. Germain, in whose houses he was an habitué.

His social activity may have been deliberate preparation for his work,
as his fifteen-year apprenticeship to Ruskin was preparation. Or it may
have been a pose, much the same as his mannerisms, habits, customs,
and possibly some features of his invalidism, were a pose. Surely he
enjoyed the reputation of being “different.”

He ruminated on Rousseau and studied Saint-Simon. When he arrived at
the stage where he could scoff at one and spurn the other, he learned
Henry James by heart. Then he wrote; he had prepared himself. The
deficit which art and endeavour failed to wipe out was compensated by
his maternal inheritance.

One may infer whither he is going by reading Proust once, but to
accompany him he must be read a second time. Those who would get
instruction and enlightenment must read him as Ruskin, his master,
said all worth while books must be read: “You must get into the habit
of looking intensely at words and assuring yourself of their meaning,
syllable by syllable.”

The discerning reader must look intensely at M. Proust's words. If he
looks long enough they seem to take on the appearance of _Mene, Tekel,
Phares_.




                              CHAPTER VI
  TWO LITERARY LADIES OF LONDON: KATHERINE MANSFIELD AND REBECCA WEST


Many persons are so constituted that they accept any positive statement
as fact unless they know it to be false. Few more positive statements
are made in print than “So and So is England's or America's or France's
leading or most popular writer of fiction or verse.” Publicity agents
have found apparently that such claim sells books and needs no
substantiation. The reading public rarely protests. It denies in a more
effective way, but before the denial gets disseminated many credulous
seekers of diversion and culture are misled.

There are several young women writing fiction in England today of whom
it can be said truthfully that they ornament the profession of letters.
Women have long justified their reputation for being intuitive by their
fictional writing. It is likely that they may proceed to establish
an equal reputation for accurate observation, logical inference, and
temperate narrative. Had not the waves of death recently encompassed
Katherine Mansfield in her early maturity she would have remained at
the top of the list, the place where now, varying with individual taste
and judgment, stand the names of Dorothy Richardson, Rebecca West,
Stella Benson, Virginia Woolf, Sheila Kaye-Smith, Mary Webb, Rose
Macaulay, to mention no others. For the first time in history women
prose writers preponderate, and it is a good augury for a country which
has been so quickly and successfully purged of anti-feminism.

Katherine Mansfield's output has been small, but quality has made
up for quantity. Her reputation is founded on two volumes of short
stories. To say that they reveal capacity to create life, to recognise
the temperament, intellectuality, and morality of the ordinary human
beings that one encounters, and to display their behaviour; as well
as a power to analyse personality and to depict individuality that
equals de Maupassant, is to make a truthful statement, and a temperate
one. Indeed, she seemed to her contemporaries to be possessed of some
unsanctified and secret wisdom.

Her history is brief. She was Kathleen Beauchamp, third daughter of
a man of affairs, recently knighted, and was born in Wellington, New
Zealand. She was 23 years old when she married, just before the war,
J. Middleton Murry, the British critic and novelist. Her first book
“In a German Pension,” published when she was 21, gave no promise of
great talent. Her first mature work was a series of book reviews in
_The Nation and Athenæum_, about 1919. She was quickly recognised to
be a subtle and brilliant critic. In 1920 the publication of “Bliss
and Other Stories” revealed her metal and temper. Development and
maturity marked her second and last collection, “The Garden-Party and
Other Stories,” which followed in 1922. Hardly had the promise of her
early work been recognised before it was overshadowed by progressive
pulmonary disease, and after long months of illness, during which she
was obliged to spend most of her time away from England, she died in
France on January 9, 1923.

Katherine Mansfield had a technique which may be compared to that of
a great stage manager. When the play is put on, the scenes and the
characters, the atmosphere and the environment, the sentiment and the
significance are satisfying, intelligent and convincing. The world seen
through her eyes, and the conduct of its most highly organised product,
is the world that may be seen by anyone who has normal, keen vision.
The conduct of the people who encumber it is that which an observer
without inherited bias or acquired bigotry knows intuitively, and has
learned from experience, is the conduct that reflects our present
development, our attitudes, our interests, our desires, and most of all
our dispositions.

[Illustration: KATHERINE MANSFIELD]

She prepared the stage and then her characters came on. She didn't
bore with narrative of their birth, weary with incidents of their
development, or disgust with details of their vegetative existence.
They reacted to their immediate desires and environment in the way that
people act in real life. She had a comprehensive understanding of human
motives, and she realised how firmly engrained in man is the organic
lust to live and to experience pleasure.

To find the balance in fiction midway between the “joy stuff” which for
the last decade has been threatening to reduce American literature to
a spineless pulp, and morbid realism which, in both England and this
country, has been reflecting the influence of so-called psychoanalysis,
is an accomplishment deserving of the thanks of all admirers of sanity
in art. Miss Mansfield has succeeded in doing this, with the result
that a large measure of the charm of her art lies in its sanity,
its extraordinary freedom from obsessions, from delusions, and from
excessive egocentricity. To borrow a term from music, she may be said
to have possessed an unerring sense of pitch.

The easiest way of estimating any unknown element is to compare it
to something already known, and Katherine Mansfield has been called
the Chekhov of English fiction. Such a comparison may be useful as an
approach to her work. In truth, however, while her position in English
fiction may be compared with that of the illustrious Russian, she is in
no sense an imitator, a disciple of him or of any one else. Her art is
her own.

It can best be estimated from study of her last published story. If
Katherine Mansfield, feeling herself already drawn into the shadow of
approaching death, had tried to leave the world one final sample of
her art which would epitomise her message and her method, “The Fly,”
published in _The Nation and Athenæum_ of March 18, 1922, is a lasting
triumph of her success. In a story of twenty-five hundred words she
has said more than most authors say in a one-hundred-thousand word
novel, or, indeed, in many novels. Not only is every word pregnant
with meaning, but for those who can read between the lines there is an
indictment of the life she is picturing too poignant for any but strong
souls who can look upon the wine of life when it is red; who can even
drain the cup to the bitter dregs in their sincere desire to learn its
truth, without suffering the draft to send its poison into their souls.
It is not that Katherine Mansfield was poisoned with the bitterness of
life, or weakened with the taint of pessimism. On the contrary, she
was as immune to bitterness, to poison, to weakness, as a disembodied
spirit would be to disease. She was like pure white glass, reflecting
fearlessly the part of life that was held before her, but never
colouring it with her own personality. Her reflection was impartial.

In “The Fly” the _dramatis personæ_ are old Mr. Woodifield, the boss,
and the fly. Old Mr. Woodifield is not described, but the reader sees
him, small of body and of soul, shrivelled, shaky, wheezy, as he
lingers in the big, blatantly new office chair on one of the Tuesdays
when, since the “stroke” and retirement from his clerkship, he has
escaped from the solicitude of the wife and the girls back into his
old life in the city--“we cling to our last pleasures as the tree
clings to its last leaves”--and revelled in the sense of being a guest
in the boss's office. The boss is more graphic because he remains
nameless. “Stout, rosy, five years older than Mr. Woodifield and
still going strong, still at the helm” is what we are told he is, but
this is what we see: A brutal, thick man, purring at the admiration
of the old clerk for his prosperity revealed in the newly “done-up”
office; self-satisfied, selfish, and supercilious, offering a glass
of whiskey as a panacea for the old man's tottering pitifulness, and
then listening, insolently tolerant, to the rambling outpourings of
the old soul, harmless, disciplined to long poverty of purse, of life,
of thought, about the “Girls” visit to the soldier's grave in Belgium
and the price they paid for a pot of jam. Then the picture changes.
The shuffling footsteps of the old man have died out, the door is
closed for half-an-hour, the photograph of a “grave-looking boy in
uniform standing in one of those spectral photographers' parks with
photographers' storm-clouds behind him,” looks out at the boss who has
“arranged to weep.” But the floodgates which have opened at the tap of
the one sentiment of which the boss was capable are now suffering from
the rust of six years. Tears refuse to come.

A fly drops into the pot of ink, and the boss, absent-mindedly noticing
its struggles for freedom, picks it out with a pen and shakes it on
to the blotting paper, where the little animal makes a heroic effort
to clean off the ink and get ready for life again. But the boss has
an idea. In spite of himself, his admiration is aroused by the fly's
struggle, his pluck--“that was the way to tackle things, that was the
right spirit. Never say die; it was only a question of.... But the
fly has again finished its laborious task and the boss has just time
to refill his pen, to shake fair and square on the newly cleaned body
yet another dark drop. What about it this time?” And yet another.
“He plunged his pen back into the ink, leaned his thick wrist on the
blotting paper, and as the fly tried its wings, down came a great
heavy blot. What would it make of that?... Then the boss decided
that this time should be the last, as he dipped the pen deep in the
inkpot. It was. The last blot fell on the soaked blotting-paper and the
bedraggled fly lay in it and did not stir.” And as he rings for some
new blotting-paper, a feeling of unaccountable wretchedness seizes him
and he falls to wondering what it was he had been thinking about before
the fly had attracted his attention. “For the life of him, he could not
remember.” And that is the end of the story.

Katherine Mansfield's art resembles that of the great Russian
physician-novelist in that she preaches no sermon, points no moral,
expounds no philosophy. Although there is no available exposition of
her theories, her work is evidence that her conception of art was
to depict the problematic as it was presented to her, and leave the
interpretation to the reader's own philosophy. She made Raoul Duquette
say, in “Je ne parle pas Française,” one of the most psychologically
remarkable of her stories: “People are like portmanteaux, packed with
certain things, started going, thrown about, tossed away, dumped down,
lost and found, half emptied suddenly or squeezed fatter than ever
until finally the Ultimate Porter swings them on to the Ultimate Train,
and away they rattle.” That may have been her own belief.

While it may be true in a certain sense that the artist sees only
himself in his art, there is an essential difference between seeing
himself reflected in life and in seeing life as in himself. Katherine
Mansfield habitually did the latter. And it is this fact that enabled
her to use as models, or accessories, or background any of the chance
travellers she may have encountered with almost equal success. If she
ever reflected herself in her art, it was a normal and objective self,
a self which was interested in the drama being enacted about her, not
merely the drama of her own soul; and in the fine points of this drama
as well as in its leading actors and more obvious aspects.

Her world from which she has gathered the material for her two books of
stories has been richly variegated, and her readers are given the full
benefit of a versatile experience. She was _La Gioconda_ of English
fiction writers. “Je ne parle pas Française” shows that she knew
the soul maladies and, like Walter Pater's conception of Leonardo's
masterpiece, she knew some of the secrets of the grave: though she had
not “been a diver in deep seas,” nor “trafficked for strange webs with
Eastern merchants.” She did not _finish_ an individual. She narrated
an episode which revealed his or her character; she didn't lead up to
some epochal event like marriage, a dramatic reconciliation, a studied
folly, or a crime. She depicted an episode, and left you to put
such interpretation upon it, or to continue it, as your experience,
imagination, or desire might suggest. She was a picture maker, not
pigment by pigment, cell by cell, but with great sweeps of the brush.

She usually depicted sentimental _men_, whose long suits were fidelity
and constancy, or men whose fundamental urges were not harmonised
to convention. Her women were, in the main, fickle, designing,
inconstant, shallow, truckling, vain. “Marriage à la Mode,” is a
specimen. William keeps his romantic and sentimental view of life
after prosperity and progeny come. Isabel doesn't. She is all for
progress and evolution--new house, new environment, new friends, new
valuation of life's possessions. He goes home for week-ends chockful
of love and sentimentality. She meets him at the station with her new
friends--sybarites and hedonists in search of sensation. He soon finds
he isn't in the game at all as Isabel now plays it. So he decides to
abbreviate his visit. On the way back to town he concocts a long letter
full of protestations of unselfish love, and willingness to stand aside
if his presence is a drag on her happiness. She reads it aloud to her
guests who receive it with sneers and jeers. Isabel has a moment of
self-respect, and withdraws to her room and experiences the vulgarity
and loathesomeness of her conduct. She will write to William at once
and dispel his fears and reassure him, but while she is holding her
character up to her eyes disparagingly she hears her guests calling her
and decides “I'll go with them and write to William later--some other
time. Not now. But I shall _certainly_ write.” Procrastination, not
hesitation, condition her downfall.

In “Je ne parle pas Française” she handled a subject--the implantation
of the genesic instinct--in such a way that the reader may get little
or much from it, depending upon his knowledge and experience. But in
the lines and between the lines there is exposition of practically all
that is known of the strange deviations of the libido. Raoul Duquette
and Dick, his English friend, who cannot kill his mother, cannot give
her the final blow of letting her know that he has fallen in love with
Mouse, are as truly drawn to life as Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud,
or as Encolpius and Giton of the Satyricon.

It is a far cry from the depths glimpsed--but with such terrible
sureness--in this story, to the budding soul of a young girl from the
country as pictured in Leila in “Her First Ball”; or to the very spirit
of healthy youth, both frivolous, superficial youth, and sensitive
idealising youth, which exudes from the pages of “The Garden-Party.”

She depicted transformation of mental states, the result of suggestion
or impulse, much as a prestidigitator handles his Aaron's rod. This is
particularly well seen in Leila. The reader shares her joyous mental
state, full of vistas of hope and love and joy. Then a fat man who has
been going to parties for thirty years dances with her and pictures her
future follies, strifes, struggles, and selfishness at forty. At once
she realises her doll is stuffed with sawdust, and cries and wants to
go home, but a young man comes along, dances with her again, and behold
the filling isn't sawdust, but radium!

Katherine Mansfield's art may be studied in such a story as “At the
Bay.” The _dramatis personæ_ are: Beryl, a temperamental young lady
looking for romance, seeking fulfilment of destiny, thwarted by a
Narcissus inhibition; Linda, her sister, without temperament, to whom
fulfilment is repellant; Mrs. Harry Kember, unmoral and immoral, a
vampire with a past and keen for a future; Harry Kember, her husband of
whom many things are said, but none adequate to describe him; Stanley
Burnell, a conventional good man--mollycoddle; Jonathan Trout, a poet
compelled by fate to be a drone; Alice, a servant in transformation
from chrysalis to butterfly; Mrs. Stubbs, a vegetative hedonist; and
several delightful children and a devoted “Granma.”

They spend a holiday at the seashore and Beryl looks for romance. Here
is the picture:

    “Very early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole
    of Crescent Bay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big
    bush-covered hills at the back were smothered. You could not see
    where they ended and the paddocks and bungalows began. The sandy
    road was gone and the paddocks and bungalows the other side of
    it; there were no white dunes covered with reddish grass beyond
    them; there was nothing to mark which was beach and where was
    the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was blue. Big drops
    hung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery, fluffy
    toi-toi was limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and
    the pinks in the bungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with
    wetness. Drenched were the cold fuchsias, round pearls of dew
    lay on the flat nasturtium leaves. It looked as though the sea
    had beaten up softly in the darkness, as though one immense wave
    had come tippling, rippling--how far? Perhaps if you had waked
    up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish
    flicking in at the window and gone again....”

You feel the wetness of it. Then come the first signs of waking up in
the place: the shepherd with his dog and flock making for the Downs,
the cat waiting on the gatepost for the milk-girl--harbingers of the
day's activities.

Then the picture is animated.

    “A few minutes later the back door of one of the bungalows
    opened, and a figure in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down
    the paddock, cleared the stile, rushed through the tussock
    grass into the hollow, staggered up the sandy hillock, and
    raced for dear life over the big porous stones, over the
    cold, wet pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed like oil.
    Splish-splosh! Splish-splosh! The water bubbled round his legs
    as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting. First man in as usual!
    He'd beaten them all again. And he swooped down to souse his
    head and neck.”

This is a complete revelation of his character--smug, righteous,
selfish, the centre of a world in which every tomorrow shall be like
today, and today is without romance. He feels cheated when Jonathan
Trout tries to talk to him.

    “But curse the fellow! He'd ruined Stanley's bathe. What an
    unpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again,
    and then as quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the
    beach.”

There is something pathetic in his determination to make a task of
everything, even the entailments of matrimony.

    “You couldn't help feeling he'd be caught out one day, and then
    what an almighty cropper he'd come! At that moment an immense
    wave lifted Jonathan, rode past him, and broke along the beach
    with a joyful sound. What a beauty! And now there was another.
    That was the way to live--carelessly, recklessly, spending
    oneself. He got on to his feet and began to wade towards the
    shore, pressing his toes into the firm, wrinkled sand. To take
    things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of life, but
    to give way to it--that was what was needed. It was this tension
    that was all wrong. To live--to live!”

The whole world of his home moves round Stanley. When he returns for
breakfast he has every member of the family working for him. When Beryl
does not help him at once, its mechanism must be dislocated. But Linda
he can't draw into the net. “Linda's vagueness on these occasions could
not be real, Stanley decided.”

The bathing hour on the beach for the women and children is as vivid as
if taken by a camera.

    “The firm, compact little girls were not half so brave as the
    tender, delicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering,
    crouching down, slapping the water, never hesitated. But Isabel,
    who could swim twelve strokes, and Kezia, who could nearly swim
    eight, only followed on the strict understanding they were not
    to be splashed. As for Lottie, she didn't follow at all. She
    liked to be left to go in her own way, please. And that way was
    to sit down at the edge of the water, her legs straight, her
    knees pressed together, and to make vague motions with her arms
    as if she expected to be wafted out to sea. But when a bigger
    wave than usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in
    her direction, she scrambled to her feet with a face of horror
    and flew up the beach again.”

Mrs. Harry Kember and Beryl give an exhibition of the vampire and the
novice, while Linda dreams the morning away in revery and retrospect.
Beryl's dream of romance when she is alone in the garden after
everybody else in the household has gone to bed receives a rude jolt
from Harry Kember.

The story is illustrative of Miss Mansfield's art in leaving her
characters without killing or marrying them or bringing great adventure
into their lives. It leaves one with a keen interest in what is next
for Beryl, although she is not the most attractive of the figures in
the story, but there is no indication that we shall meet her again.
“Granma” and the children are the features of this story, and appear as
real as life. The author's faculty in making the reader interested in
characters who do not play heroic or leading rôles is distinctive. Even
the sheep-dog's encounter with the cat on the gatepost is delightful,
also the glimpse of Mrs. Stubbs' cottage with its array of bathing
suits and shoes and the lady's reception of Alice are art: “With her
broad smile and the long bacon knife in her hand, she looked like a
friendly brigand.”

“Prelude,” the introductory story of “Bliss and Other Stories,” is
a further revelation of Beryl, with side lights on her sister Linda
and Linda's husband, Stanley, and her quite wonderful mother. The
Narcissus in Beryl has bloomed. Forced to accept bed and board from her
brother-in-law, she bewails her fate while chanting the praises of her
physical charms and mental possessions. Linda, by this time, has given
herself all the air of confirmed invalidism. Linda gets her emotional
appeasement from what might have been; Beryl, from what is going to
be--both foundationed in introspection. When Linda first met Stanley
out in Australia she scorned him, but previous to or after their
marriage she fell in love with him. But her antipathy to childbearing
and her fear of it are so profound that they colour all her thoughts
and emotions. This is best seen when she relates her dream about birds.

“Prelude” is not a story of Linda, but of Beryl and her hypocrisy.
It should be dovetailed into “At the Bay.” The overtures and the
temptation which were made to her by Mr. and Mrs. Harry Kember have
not borne fruit. She is in love with herself and it may be that that
is what the author meant to convey. The description of herself and
her comment on her own appearance: “Yes, my dear, there is no doubt
about it, you really are a lovely little thing” is very illuminating.
She persuades herself that she is a potential Nina Declos and that
if opportunity had not been denied her she could rival Messalina.
Hypocrisy is bearing in on her and it is not quite evident, at the
close of “Prelude,” where it is going to lead her.

The burden of the story is to intensify interest in Beryl, and her
influences and surroundings, and to heighten the suspense of the
reader. On finishing “At the Bay” one has a picture of the romantic
girl; at the close of “Prelude” one feels that something is going to
happen to her before the author finishes with her. The reader gets no
clue, however, to what it might be, except that it would be the working
out of her temperament--admiration for self and longing for romance
through which to express this self. Her longing at first seemed to be
for expression of self biologically and intellectually; now it seems
to be to find a setting in which to frame becomingly this adorable
self--an essential difference in character and the difference that is
the axis upon which the story might be expected to turn. If people are
their temperaments, it is such subtle differences of temperament which
determine destiny, or what they shall work out for themselves from
given circumstances.

Beryl is more cold-blooded, more calculating than she at first appeared
to be, and never again will she be in danger of capitulating to a
Kember. What she wants is to shine, and she is going to use her valued
attractions designedly as currency to accomplish this. Beryl and Linda
are studies in selfishness and introspection. The latter is phlegmatic
and lazy, mentally and emotionally as well as physically.

“Granma” and the children are still the most attractive figures in the
family. How such a woman as “Granma” could have had daughters like
Beryl and Linda is truer to life than to fiction. Had we known their
father they might not have been so enigmatic.

Katherine Mansfield had a genius for catching the exact meaning of
the little touches in life, the little ironies and comedies as well
as the single little wild flower in a rank growth of weeds. She was
delightfully objective. She had a quality rare in women writers,
especially, of not putting all her treasures in one basket, of not
concentrating upon one character and that character more or less the
expression of herself; and of being interested in the whole drama as it
passed. She could enter into the soul of a charwoman or a cat and take
a snap-shot of it which made the reader love the charwoman or the cat,
as well as she could paint a picture that gives the very atmosphere
of children at play or of dawn at the seashore or night in a quiet
house--even better than she could make an X-ray study of the soul of a
selfish woman or a stupid self-righteous man.

The “high light” of “The Garden-Party” is the contrast between a
typical happy prosperous family and an equally unhappy poor one; a
garden-party for the young girls of the first family, the accidental
death of the man and the wage-earner of the second. One lives on the
hill in the sunlight; the other in the damp forbidding hollow below.
They are near neighbours in point of space; strangers in all other
respects. One makes an art of the graces and pleasures of life; the
other is familiar with the gloom typified by poverty and death.
Both accept their existences unquestioningly, in worlds as different
psychologically as they are physically.

The author does not preach; there is no straining for effect. Laura,
one of three sisters, is more sensitive than the other members of the
family. She alone feels contrasts. She is revelling in the preparations
for the garden-party when she hears from the workmen of the man's
sudden death, and her joy is clouded. But her mother and sisters make
light of it, and the party proceeds--a picture of average wholesome
young joyousness. Then the mother sends Laura, with a basket of cakes,
to the man's family. The dramatic contrast is in Laura's impressions
when she goes, in her party clothes, with the frivolous-looking basket,
down into the hollow at dusk. That is all. There is no antagonism, no
questioning of fate, no sociology--just a picture. Only the ability
not to use an extra word, the taste and the humour which kept out any
mawkishness saved the story from being “sob stuff.”

When Katherine Mansfield read virtues into her female characters she
usually made them humble, lowly, or plain, such as Ma Parker, Miss
Brill, and Beryl's mother. She could introduce Ma Parker who cleaned
the flat of the literary gentleman every Tuesday, and in eleven pages,
without a single approach to sentimentality, make you in love with the
old scrubwoman, with her hard life and heroic unselfish soul, when you
left her standing in the cold street wondering whether there was any
place in the world where she could have a cry at last. The motive of
this story is much the same as that of “The Garden-Party,” the sharp
contrast between two extreme types of life which circumstances bring
close together.

In “The Daughters of the Late Colonel” the author walked with a sure
step on thin ice from the first sentence to the last, never taking a
false step or undignified slide. Humour alone preserved the balance
where the ice was not too thin, and kept her from slipping over the
invisible line of safety in the direction of bathos on the one side,
or of the coarsely comic on the other. To make two old ladies who had
spent their lives “looking after father, and at the same time keeping
out of father's way” and who at father's death find themselves among
those whom life had passed by, interesting and intriguing, is a severe
test for a writer. Not only are they dead emotionally, but their habit
of thought has become too set to be readjusted to their new freedom.
Miss Mansfield made them as funny as they naturally would have been,
without “making fun” of them. Their funniness is lovable. For instance:

    “At the cemetery while the coffin was lowered, to think that
    she and Constantia had done this thing without asking his
    permission. What would father say when he found out? For he was
    bound to find out sooner or later. He always did. 'Buried. You
    two girls had me buried.' She could hear his stick thumping.”

Or when the organ-grinding and the spot of sunshine on their mother's
picture start in both silent reminiscence as to whether life might have
been different if she had lived.

    “Might they have married? But there had been nobody for them to
    marry. There had been father's Anglo-Indian friends before he
    quarrelled with them. But after that she and Constantia never
    met a single man except clergymen. How did one meet men? Or even
    if they'd met them, how could one have got to know men well
    enough to be more than strangers? One read of people having
    adventures, being followed, and so on. But nobody had ever
    followed Constantia and her.”

“Miss Brill” is a sketch with a whimsical pathos. A little old maiden
lady who dresses up every Sunday and goes to the _Jardin Publiques_ in
Paris and sits on a bench, getting her romance out of watching people
and feeling that she is a part of the passing life, goes one Sunday as
usual. The feature in the sketch is the little fur piece around her
neck.

    “Miss Brill put up her hand and touched her fur. Dear little
    thing! It was nice to feel it again. She had taken it out of its
    box that afternoon, shaken out the mothpowder, given it a good
    brush, and rubbed the life back into the dim little eyes.”

It is to her like a pet animal or even a child. At first she finds the
park less interesting than usual, but finally, as she senses romance
in a pair of park lovers who sit down on her bench, she hears the boy
say, “that stupid old thing at the end there. Why does she come here at
all--who wants her? Why doesn't she keep her silly old mug at home?”
And the girl, giggling, replies, “It's her fu-fur which is so funny....
It's exactly like a fried whiting.” Suddenly the romance and the joy
have all gone out of the old lady, and when she lays away her little
fur piece in its box sadly and puts on the lid she thinks she hears
something crying.

Ability to depict the hidden speck of beauty under an uncompromising
exterior not only inspired some of Katherine Mansfield's finest
touches, but is especially refreshing after acquaintance with many
writers who seem bent solely upon discovering some inmost rottenness
and turning upon it the X-rays. There are many old ladies in this book,
and the loving skill with which she has reproduced for the reader the
charm she was able to see in them is indicative not only of her art,
but also of her essential wholesomeness.

“The Man Without a Temperament” is an objective study of an unpopular
man. One knows him from the few outward glimpses given of him as well
as if the author had made an intensive psychological study of him.
That is, one knows him as one knows other people, not as he knows
himself. The sketch is pregnant with irony and pathos. Without a
temperament--unfeeling--is the world's verdict of him. In reality, he
has more feeling than his critics. What he lacks is not feeling, but
expression. He is like a person with a pocketful of “paper” who has
to walk because he hasn't change to pay his carfare, or to go hungry
because he can't pay for a meal. People who know him trust him, even
if they do not fancy him or feel quite at ease with him; but with
strangers he has no chance. A life study of such a character would make
him interesting. A photograph shows him as one of the people who “never
take good pictures.”

In “Bliss and Other Stories,” the author went into deeper water than in
the other collection. She was less concerned with the little ironies
and with the fine points of her characters, and more with great
passions.

“Bliss,” the story, shows the same method as do many of her other
stories, but reversed. It is as if her reel were being run before the
reader backwards. Instead of hunting out the one flower in a patch
of weeds, she painted a young married woman's Garden of Eden and
then hunted down the snake. From the first note of Bertha Young's
unexplainable bliss one knows that the snake motive is coming, but
does not know how or where. The feeling of it runs through Bertha's
psychical sense of secret understanding--the “something in common”
between herself and Pearl Fulton, who, by a subtle uncanniness, is made
to suggest a glorified “vamp.” The leading motive of the story is the
psychic sympathy between the women, who are antitheses. Commonly such
a sense of understanding would take the form of antipathy. That it
is attraction--harking back in all likelihood to something in Bertha
remote and unrecognised--constitutes the distinctiveness of the motive.
The art is revealed in a clear-cut picture--nothing more. Katherine
Mansfield knew so marvellously where to stop. She had a good eye, a
deft hand, an understanding mind, a sense of humour, and she loved her
fellow-beings.

Until “The Judge” was published Miss Rebecca West, in the opinion of
many amateur and professional critics, was the most promising young
woman to enter the field of literature in the reign of King George. Her
advent to the literary world was impressive, and in a little book on
Henry James in the “Writers of the Day” series she revealed a capacity
of interpretation and facility of expression which made her elders
envious and her contemporaries jealous. It was obvious to the casual
reader of this book, and of her journalistic contributions, that not
only had she the artistic temperament, but that she was familiar with
its display in others, and that she had read widely, discriminatingly,
and understandingly. Moreover, she was a thoroughly emancipated young
woman and bore no marks of the cage that had restrained her sex. Her
cleverness, her erudition, her resourcefulness were admitted. It was
rated to be an asset, also, that she did not hesitate to call a spade
a spade or to use the birch unsparingly when she felt it was for the
benefit of the reading public, misled and deluded as it so often is
by false prophets, erring evangelists, and self-seeking promoters. In
other words, though she had sentiment and sympathy, she knew how to use
them judiciously. In “Notes on Novels” she constantly reminds herself
that there is a draught that we must drink or not be fully human. One
must know the truth. When one is adult one must raise to one's lips the
wine of truth, heedless that it is not sweet like milk but draws the
mouth with its strength, and celebrate communion with reality, or else
walk forever queer and small like a dwarf. Miss West does not intend
that her countrymen shall display these deformities.

Her first novel, “The Return of the Soldier,” a fictional exposition
of the Freudian wish, was acclaimed by critics as the first fulfilment
of the promise she had given. The teachings of the Austrian mystic
were not much known then in England, the country that now seems to
have swallowed them, bait, line, and sinker, not only in the fields
of fiction but in pedagogy and in medicine; so Miss West's little
book was more widely read and discussed than it might be today when
Miss May Sinclair, Mr. J. D. Beresford, Mr. D. H. Lawrence, and many
other popular novelists have made his theories look like facts to the
uninitiated.

The story is of Christopher, the ideal type of young Englishman who
knows how to fight and to love.

    “He possessed in a great measure the loveliness of young men,
    which is like the loveliness of the spring, foal or the sapling,
    but in him it was vexed with a serious and moving beauty by the
    inhabiting soul. To see him was to desire intimacy with him so
    that one might intervene between this body which was formed
    for happiness and the soul which cherished so deep a faith in
    tragedy.”

It is narrated by his cousin who has loved him platonically since
youth. Chris had a romantic and ardent love affair with an inn-keeper's
daughter in his youth, but he married Kitty, a beautiful little
conventional non-temperamental young woman with a charming and
cultivated soprano voice, of the class of women who

    “are obscurely aware it is their civilising mission to flash the
    jewel of their beauty before all men so that they shall desire
    and work to get the wealth to buy it, and thus be seduced by
    a present appetite to a tilling of the earth that serves the
    future.”

He goes to the war, gets concussion of the brain which causes amnesia,
or forgetfulness of certain epochal events in his life, particularly
his marriage to Kitty. “Who the devil is Kitty?” he replies when he
is told she might have something to say on hearing of his plan to
marry Margaret Allingham. Though some of the events of his life from
twenty-one, when he fell in love with Margaret, to thirty-six, when
he got injured, can be revived in his memory by Jenny, a resourceful
understanding person, the sort of cousin every man should have, no
argumentation can reconcile him to Kitty, and “he said that his body
and soul were consumed with desire for Margaret and that he would never
rest until he once more held her in his arms.”

After exhausting every means that love and science can suggest to jog
his memory or wipe out the amnesia, it is decided to bring him and
Margaret together. No one who had known her as the “Venus of Monkey
Island,” a composite of charity and love, would recognise her now,
seamed and scarred and ravaged by squalid circumstance, including
dreary matrimony to a man with a weak chest that needed constant
attention. Moreover, “all her life long Margaret had partaken of the
inalienable dignity of a requited love, and lived with men who wore
carpet slippers in the house.” Such experience had left deforming
scars. However, Chris sees her with the eyes of youth, and her presence
resurrects juvenile emotions. Under their influence Margaret undergoes
transformation.

    “She had a little smile in her eyes as though she were listening
    to a familiar air played far away, her awkwardness seemed
    indecision as to whether she would walk or dance to that distant
    music, her shabbiness was no more repulsive than the untidiness
    of a child who had been so eager to get to the party that it has
    not let its nurse fasten its frock.”

However, their interviews do not get them anywhere from Kitty's
standpoint, and she decides to send for Dr. Gilbert Anderson.

    “Heaven knows she had no reason for faith in any doctor, for
    during the past week so many of them sleek as seals with their
    neatly brushed hair and their frockcoats, had stood around Chris
    and looked at him with the consequential deliberation of a
    plumber.”

But Dr. Anderson was different.

    “He was a little man with winking blue eyes, a flushed and
    crumpled forehead, a little grey moustache that gave him the
    profile of an amiable cat and a lively taste in spotted ties,
    and he lacked that appetiteless look which is affected by
    distinguished practitioners.”

Dr. Anderson explains to the family that Christopher's amnesia is the
manifestation of a suppressed wish and that his unconscious self
is refusing to let him resume his relations with his normal life.
He forgot his life with his wife because he was discontented, and
there was no justification for it for “Kitty was the falsest thing
on earth, in tune with every kind of falsity.” The doctor proposes
psychoanalysis, but Margaret says she knows a memory so strong that it
will recall everything else, in spite of his discontent, the memory of
the boy, his only child who had died five years before. Dr. Anderson
urges her to take Christopher something the boy had worn, some toy they
used to play with. So she takes a jersey and ball and meets Chris in
the garden where there is only a column of birds swimming across the
lake of green light that lays before the sunset, and as Chris gazes
at Margaret mothering them in her arms the scales fall from his eyes
and he makes obeisance to convention and bids his creative libido _au
revoir_.

Jenny is witness of the transformation and when Kitty asks “How does he
look?” she answers, though her tongue cleaves to the roof of her mouth,
“Every inch a soldier.”

When Miss West next essayed fiction in “The Judge” it was the
diagnosis of the creative urge that was her theme. It is one of
Freud's contentions that the male child, before it hears the voice
of conscience and the admonition of convention, has carnal yearnings
for the mother, the female child for the father. With the advent of
sense, with the development of individuality, with the recognition of
obligation to others, and particularly with the acquisition of the
sense of morality, these are replaced with what are called normal
desires. In some instances the transformation does not take place. The
original trend remains, and it is spoken of as an infantile fixation.
Its juvenile and adult display is called sin ethically and crime
socially.

The wages of sin still is death, according to Miss West's portrayal,
but it is not called sin. It is merely behaviourism interpreted in the
light of the New Psychology.

“Every mother is a judge who sentences the children for the sins of
the father” is her thesis. As a work of art “The Judge” has elicited
much praise. As a human document, a mirror held up to actual life, a
statement of the accepted facts of heredity and of behaviour, and of
the dominancy and display of passion, lust, jealousy, anger, revenge, I
doubt that it merits unqualified approbation.

Marion Yaverland, daughter of a Kentish father and a French mother,
had yielded without compunction to the wooing of the local squire and
had borne a child, Richard, around whose development, personality, and
loving the story is built.

    “Vitality itself had been kneaded into his flesh by his parents'
    passion. He had been begotten when beauty, like a strong
    goddess, pressed together the bodies of his father and mother,
    hence beauty would disclose more of her works to him than to
    other sons of men with whose begetting she was not concerned.”

But the goddess did not give him straight genesic endowment, so he
was not able to keep filial love and carnal love in their proper
channels. And from this flowed all the tragedy. His mother realised his
infirmity, though she didn't look upon it as an infirmity, from the
earliest days; and, unfortunately, she did not attempt to eradicate
it--if it is ever eradicable.

Squire Harry behaved badly to Marion, save financially, and public
opinion backed up by a stoning in the streets (a real Old Testament
touch) by a moron and his more youthful companions, made her accept an
offer of marriage from the squire's butler, a loathsome creature called
Peacey. In proposing marriage and promising immunity to its obligations
he said:

    “Marion, I hope you understand what I'm asking you to do. I'm
    asking you to marry me. But not to be my wife. I never would
    bother you for that. I'm getting on in life, you see, so that I
    can make the promise with some chance of keeping it.”

But Peacey deceived no one save Marion. Miss West's description of
the one visit of violence which he made to his wife, and which was
followed in due time by Roger, whom Richard hated from birth, is a bit
of realism that in verisimilitude has rarely been excelled. Roger was
a pasty, snivelling, rhachitic child who developed into a high-grade
imbecile of the hobo type, and finally managed to filter through the
Salvation Army owing to some filter paper furnished by his mother that
bore the legend “For the Gov^t and Comp^a of the Bank of England.”

From earliest childhood Richard and his mother both realised that their
intimacy was unnatural and unpromising for happiness. When he was two
years old

    “He used to point his fingers at her great lustrous eyes as he
    did at flowers, and he would roll his face against the smooth
    skin of her neck and shoulders; and when he was naked after his
    bath he liked her to let down her hair so that it hung round him
    like a dark, scented tent.”

Poor little monster, how unfortunate that he could not then have been
given a hormone that would extrovert his budding perversion!

    “She always changed her dress for tea, and arranged her hair
    loosely like a woman in a picture, and went out into the garden
    to gather burning leaves and put them in vases about the room,
    and when it fell dark she set lighted candles on the table
    because they were kinder than the lamp to her pain-flawed
    handsomeness and because they kept corners of dusk in which
    these leaves glowed like fire with the kind of beauty that
    she and Richard liked. She would arrange all this long before
    Richard came in, and sit waiting in a browse of happiness,
    thinking that really she had lost nothing by being cut off from
    the love of man for this was very much better than anything she
    could have had from Harry.”

Somewhat like the way the daughter of Senator Metellus Celere, called
by some Claudia and by others Lesbia, arranged the visits of Catullus.

When Richard was sixteen he forced life's hand and leapt straight
from boyhood into manhood by leaving school where he had shown great
promise in science, and becoming a sailor so that he should be
admirable to his mother. His wanderings took him to South America
where he had great success in affairs of the heart and of the purse.
It is with disposition of the latter that the book opens in the office
of a lubricitous old Scotch solicitor where sits a young red-haired
temperamental suffragette whimpering for the moon.

Ellen Melville is a lovable Celt of seventeen, and her creator displays
a comprehensive insight into her mind and emotions. She is what Rebecca
West once was and wished to be. It is sad that the pathway of her life
leads so early to the _Via Dura_ and that Richard Yaverland had not
tarried in Vienna or Zurich to be psychoanalysed.

Richard falls in love with her at first sight. He woos her ardently,
though simply, and she responds like a “nice” girl, like a girl who
feels that for the endowment of that most wondrous thing in the world,
the cerebral cortex, it is vouchsafed her to exercise restraints and
make inhibitions which insects and animals cannot. In the highest sense
she is rational and instinctive.

Ellen goes south to visit her future mother-in-law and a few days later
Richard joins them. Roger meanwhile has “found Jesus,” and Poppy, a
Salvation Army lassie, one stage removed from “Sin.” While knocking
at Marion's door to gain entry that they may announce their intention
to marry, their gaze floats upward and they see Ellen being kissed by
the man to whom she will be married in three months. Roger, who is
instinctive but not rational, puts a wrong interpretation upon it, and
from that mal-interpretation the final tragedy flows. A few days later
Marion realises there is no happiness for Richard and Ellen so long
as she lives. She walks out into the marshes. Roger accuses Richard
of driving his mother to it “because she saw that there was something
wrong between you two.” He elaborates the accusation, and Richard
drives a bread-knife into Roger's heart.

Richard knows his doom is sealed. So he invites Ellen to share a
cattlemen's hut with him on the farther side of the creek where his
mother had drowned herself, until the people come to take him--and to
share it comprehensively.

    “Her love had not been able to reach Richard across the dark
    waters of his mother's love and how like a doom that love had
    lain on him. Since life was like this she would not do what
    Richard asked.”

But she does.

The mode in which “The Judge” is cast is noteworthy because of its
novelty and of the success attending it. Here is no sequential
narrative, no time-table of events in the order in which they happened.
The contact of Richard and Ellen is set forth in a straightforward
way, but the main thesis of the book, the Laocoon grip of mother-love
on Richard is conveyed indirectly, surreptitiously, atmospherically
rather than verbally. Ellen, though she is quite normal, senses it at
once when she meets Marion, and the writer approximates perfection of
her art most closely in narrations of the first interviews of these two
women, who are as unlike as the Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady.

While this mode may not prove an obstacle to an easy grasp of the
novel upon first reading by writers or critics, it is doubtful whether
the casual reader for diversion will comprehend its significance
without special effort and perhaps several attempts at mastering the
intricacies in the development of the story. The plan which the author
has adopted of beginning, in direct narrative form, with the mature
life of Richard and his love for Ellen, and then revealing through
retrospect and suggestion the events of his early life and that of his
mother, is a tax upon the technique of any novelist. The form has been
used with notable success by Miss Elizabeth Robins in “Camilla.” But
Miss West has not entirely mastered its difficulties, and her failure
to do so seriously mars the story.

Miss West's reputation for brilliancy has not suffered by “The Judge,”
but if one were to sentence her after reading it, he would be compelled
to say she is no novelist. If it is an index of her imaginative
capacity, of her conception of life, of her insight into conduct,
of her knowledge of behaviour, we must content ourselves with her
contributions as critic and guide.

The subject of her two novels is behaviourism of sexual motivation. It
is an index of the change that has taken place in Great Britain within
the past ten years, a change that should be acclaimed by everyone
desirous of the complete emancipation of women.

Rebecca West has leaned her ear in many a secret place where rivulets
dance their wayward round, and beauty born of murmuring sound has
passed into her soul, to paraphrase the words of one who, were he in
the flesh, would likely not meet Miss West's entire approbation.




                              CHAPTER VII
TWO LESSER LITERARY LADIES OF LONDON: STELLA BENSON AND VIRGINIA WOOLF


Miss Stella Benson and Mrs. Virginia Woolf are young women who have
come to the fore very rapidly. The former, who lived in this country
for two years after the war, published in 1915, when she was barely
out of her teens, a novel called “I Pose” which revealed an unusual
personality with an uncommon outlook on life, and an enviable capacity
to describe what she saw, felt, and fabricated. Until the appearance
of her last novel it might be said that she created types which
symbolised her ideas and attitudes and gave expression to them through
conveniently devised situations, rather than attempting to paint models
from life and placing them in a realistic environment.

“I Pose” is a story of allegorical cast lightened with flashes of
whimsical sprightliness. A pensive Gardener who likes to pose as
“original,” a Suffragette who disguises romance under a mask of
militancy, a practical girl, Courtesy, and a number of others take
an ocean voyage and have many adventures, at the end of which the
Suffragette and the Gardener find themselves in love, just as any other
young people who had been dancing and playing tennis, instead of posing
as individuals with convictions.

For the setting of her two succeeding books, “This is the End,” and
“Living Alone,” Miss Benson created a world of her own, and in a
foreword to the latter book she says:

    “This is not a real book. It does not deal with real people,
    nor should it be read by real people. But there are in the
    world so many real books already written for the benefit of real
    people, and there are still so many to be written, that I cannot
    believe that a little alien book such as this, written for the
    magically-inclined minority, can be considered too assertive a
    trespasser.”

Her world is not the traditional fairyland of the nursery, nor are the
supernatural endowments of some of the characters the classic equipment
of witches and fairies, although her _dramatis personæ_ include both
who function under the law of Magic. Rather is her dramatic machinery
in these books a vehicle in the form of a sort of delicate symbolism
for getting over a very sane attitude toward certain social foibles and
trends of today. Incidentally it gives her opportunity of expressing
this attitude in frequent witticisms and epigrammatic sayings for which
she has a gift. In “Living Alone” social service and organised charity
are the targets for her irony. She says,

    “Perception goes out of committees. The more committees you
    belong to, the less of ordinary life you will understand. When
    your daily round becomes nothing more than a round of committees
    you might as well be dead ... organizing work consists of
    sitting in 'busses bound for remote quarters of London, and
    ringing the bells of people who are almost always found to be
    away for a fortnight.”

So after Sarah Brown, whose work consists of

    “sitting every morning in a small office, collecting evidence
    from charitable spies about the Naughty Poor, and, after
    wrapping the evidence in mysterious ciphers, writing it down
    very beautifully upon little cards, so that the next spy might
    have the benefit of all his forerunners' experience,”

eats the magic sandwiches which the witch has given her for her lunch,
the scales fall from her eyes. “I am sentimental,” she says to herself.

[Illustration: STELLA BENSON]

    “It is sentimental to feel personal affection for a Case, or to
    give a child of the Naughty Poor a penny without full enquiry,
    or to say 'a-goo' to a grey pensive baby eating dirt on the
    pavement ... or in fact to confuse in any way the ideas of
    charity and love.”

She resigns her “job” and her place on the committees and goes to live
in the House of Living Alone.

In other words, Miss Benson gives the artist in her what is called
“rope.” She doesn't ask herself, “Will people think I am mad, or
infantile?” She doesn't care what “people think.” And that is an
encouraging sign. Women writers will come to their estates more
quickly and securely the more wholeheartedly they abandon themselves
to portraying instincts as they experience them, behaviour as they
observe it, motives and conduct as they sense and encounter them,
accomplishments and aspirations as they idealise them, the ideals being
founded, like the chances of race horses, on past performances.

In her last novel, “The Poor Man,” Miss Benson's art shows tremendous
development. This story is characterisation in the finest sense.
Edward, the poor man, as a psychological study, is living, vivid,
almost tragically real in the reactions which betray his inherent
defects--a poor devil who never gets a chance. Miss Benson preaches
no sermon, points no moral, makes no plea. She gives us a slice of
life--and gives it relentlessly, but justly. It is the Old Testament
justice which visits the iniquity of the father upon the third and
fourth generations, and leaves the reader with the congenial task of
finishing the sentence by supplying the mercy without which this old
world could hardly totter under the weight of this Commandment. The
story, however, makes no reference either to eugenics or to religion.
The application is for the reader to supply--if he is so inclined.
The author is not concerned with “science,” but with art. She does
not bore us with a history of Edward's heredity or of his early life.
She introduces him to us sitting in Rhoda Romero's room in San
Francisco--an unwelcome guest--without throwing light upon his previous
existence, except that he had been “shell-shocked” and had experienced
three air raids in London.

From his introduction we know Edward as we know an acquaintance, not
as we know ourselves. His tragedy is his feeble mentality and still
feebler temperament, and the heart of the tragedy is the contrast
between his intentions and his acts. Edward always means well. He is
not vicious; not lazy. But he is stupid. He wants to be decent; wants
to be liked; even wants to work. He is weak, sickly, drinks too much,
and there is nothing he knows how to do well. It is as a victim, rather
than as an aggressive wrong-doer, that we see him secretly currying
favour with school-boys he is supposed to be teaching, and ignoring
their insults, selling what belongs to others, and at last robbing a
boy of thirteen who has been left alone by his father in a hotel in
Pekin, whence Edward has gone in headlong and blind pursuit of Emily,
with whom he has become infatuated without even knowing her name. But
such is the art of his delineator that one finds oneself almost pitying
him when his infatuation climaxes in the declaration from Emily: “Can't
you leave me alone? I can't bear you. I couldn't bear to touch you--you
poor sickly thing.” It is on this note that the drama ends.

If one were obliged to confine himself to backing one entry in the
Fiction Sweepstakes now being run in England (entries limited to women
above ten and under forty), he would do well to consider carefully the
Stella Benson entry. Many would back Sheila Kaye-Smith, but the expert
and seasoned bettor would be likely to find so many characteristics of
the plough-horse that he would not waste his money.

Had Rose Macaulay not succumbed to smartness and become enslaved by
epigram, her chances would have been excellent. As it is, she attempts
to carry too much weight. The committee, the literary critics, have
done what they could to lighten it, but “Mystery at Geneva” is her
answer.

E. M. Delafield, Clemence Dane, and even G. B. Stern would be selected
by many, no doubt. But judged from their record, not on form, they
cannot be picked as winners.

The entry that is most likely to get place, if it doesn't win, is the
youngest daughter of the late Sir Leslie Stephen, Mrs. Virginia Woolf.

“Mark on the Wall,” her most important story, deals with the flood
of thought, conscious and unconscious, when so-called abstraction
is facilitated by intent gazing. The hypnotist anæsthetises the
consciousness by having the subject gaze at some bright object, she by
gazing at a snail. The illusion facilitates thought of the place and
of the lives that have been lived there. The richness of the thought
stream thus induced gives full play for her facility of expression and
capacity for pen pictures.

There is in Mrs. Woolf a note of mysticism, of spirituality which
reveals itself in a conscious or unconscious prayer for the elusive
truth. This note of itself sets her apart from the realistic woman
writers of today. Although often vividly realistic in her form, there
is in her work an essence which escapes the bounds of realism. This is
most strongly acknowledged in “Monday or Tuesday,” a volume of short
stories and sketches. The book takes its name from a little sketch of
three hundred and fifty words, for which the only accurate label is
“prose poem.” It is a direct illustration of the author's meaning when
she makes her hero say, in “The Voyage Out”:

    “You ought to write music.... Music goes straight for things.
    It says all there is to say at once. In writing it seems to me
    there's so much scratching on the match-box.”

For prose writing “Monday or Tuesday” is a triumph in the elimination
of “scratching on the match-box.” One recognises in it the longing,
more or less vaguely felt by all people, but inexpressible by most
of them who are not poets, musicians, or artists in form or colour,
for some supreme good which she calls truth. The New Psychology
would attribute it to the unconscious and call it an ugly name. But
Mrs. Woolf does not name it; she merely gives voice to the aspiration
welling up from somewhere in people's deeper selves and hovering
hauntingly, just out of range but near enough to colour the quality of
their thoughts, even when they are occupied with the most trivial and
commonplace business of life. They can never elude it, any more than
they can long elude the “Hound of Heaven,” but unlike the latter it
is not a relentless pursuer, but a lovely, tantalising wraith--always
present but never attainable or definable.

In “An Unwritten Novel,” in the same collection, Mrs. Woolf again
reveals a power of discernment, as well as the irony which is a part of
her large human sympathy, in the conclusion of the story, which opens
with:

    “Such an expression of unhappiness was enough by itself to make
    one's eyes slide over the paper's edge to the poor woman's
    face--insignificant without that look, almost a symbol of human
    destiny with it.”

During a railway journey the writer makes up a novel to fit the face
of the old woman opposite her--a story of an old maid whom life had
cheated, thwarted, and denied all expression of sex, and left her
embittered, resentful, envious, and starved.

    “They would say she kept her sorrow, suppressed her secret--her
    sex, they'd say--the scientific people. But what flummery to
    saddle her with sex!”

When she reaches her destination the old woman is met by her son--and
the “story” remains unwritten.

In “A Society,” Mrs. Woolf shies a few brick-bats--and well-aimed
ones--at modern feminism. Her gesture is, however, more one of the
irresistible impulse of the humourist to enjoy herself than any
intention to do serious violence.

The members of the Society, who are a number of young girls bent upon
self-education and believing that the object of life is to produce
good people and good books, find themselves as a result of their
investigations forced to acknowledge that if they hadn't learned to
read they might still have been bearing children in ignorance, and that
was the happiest life after all. By their learning they have sacrificed
both their happiness and their ability to produce good people, and they
are confronted, moreover, with the awful thought that if men continue
to acquire knowledge they will lose their ability to produce good books.

    “Unless we provide them with some innocent occupation we shall
    get neither good people nor good books; we shall perish beneath
    the fruits of their unbridled activity; and not a human being
    will survive to know that there once was Shakespeare.”

The Society disbands with the conclusion that when a little girl has
learned how to read “there's only one thing you can teach her to
believe in--and that is in herself.”

“Kew Gardens” is as vivid a picture as if it had been painted in
colour, of the public gardens on a hot summer day, with their
procession of varied humanity, old, young, and in the flush of life,
each flashing for a moment with all of its own intense personality,
like a figure in a cinema, before the reader, and then passing into
the shadow as vague as the breath of the flowers, the buzzing of the
dragon-fly, or the memories which for a moment the garden had invoked.

The two novels, “The Voyage Out,” published in 1915, and “Night and
Day,” in 1919, are love stories in which, through the efforts of the
lovers to find and express themselves, the author reveals her own ideas
of life. Her machinery is largely that of dialogue between the lovers,
and her chief actors are normal young men and women, wholesome in their
outlook, as well as frank in their expression of their problems, which
revolve largely around matrimony. The result is that while the novels
are introspective in a way, as well as daring in their analysis of
the author's psychology, they are free from the morbidness of many of
the introspective books of today. “The Voyage Out” is the expression
of healthy, normal youth reverently but straightforwardly seeking in
marriage the deeper values that underlie its superficialities and
justify the quality of its idealism.

In no more striking and creditable way have the women of Britain
demonstrated the legitimacy of “Rights” than by their fiction of the
past few years.




                             CHAPTER VIII
          THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIARIST: W. N. P. BARBELLION

    “The life of the soul is different. There is nothing more
    changing, more varied, more restless ... to describe the
    incidents of one hour would require eternity.”--_Journal of
    Eugénie de Guérin._


Bruce Frederick Cummings, an English entomologist and assistant at the
Natural History Museum, South Kensington, developed in early life an
infectious disease of the central nervous system called disseminated
sclerosis, which riddles the brain and spinal cord with little islets
of tissue resembling scars, and died of it October 22, 1919, in the
thirtieth year of his age. Six months before his death he published
a book entitled “The Journal of a Disappointed Man,” under the pen
name of W. N. P. Barbellion. It is not destined to live as long as
Pepys' “Diary” or Amiel's “Journal,” but it may outlive “The Journal
of Marie Bashkirtseff”--the three great diaries of the past century.
“The Journal of a Disappointed Man,” in conjunction with another called
“A Last Diary,” published after his death, may be looked upon as the
revelation of a conscious mind, as complete as the conscious mind can
make it. These books afford us opportunity to study the psychology
of one variety of self-revelation, just as the books of James Joyce
and Dorothy Richardson permit study of the subconscious mind, and
more specifically undirected or wishful thinking, technically called
autistic.

While absolute classification of people is always inaccurate and
misleading, still for the convenience of this study, in order to bring
into high relief the features which distinguish Barbellion's diaries
from the other three great self-revelations of the conscious mind,
the authors mentioned may be said to typify four distinct classes of
diarists. The immortal Pepys may be dismissed with the words: pedant,
philosopher, humourist. Amiel may be considered the mystic poet, with
emphasis upon the spiritual side of his nature; Marie Bashkirtseff, the
emotional artist whose talent was interpretive rather than creative;
and Barbellion, the man of science, direct, forceful, effective on
his objective side, but subjectively morbid and egocentric, unable to
estimate correctly his own limitations or to direct his emotions into
channels which would have made for happy living or sane thinking.

Cummings began to keep a diary when he was thirteen years old, and
after seventeen years he had accumulated twenty post-quarto volumes
of manuscript. Two years before his death he made an entry “Am busy
rewriting, editing and bowdlerising my Journal for publication against
the time when I shall have gone the way of all flesh. Reading it
through again, I see what a remarkable book I have written.” In it and
in another small volume published posthumously, called “The Joy of
Life,” he said,

    “You will find much of Bruce Frederick Cummings as he appears
    to his Maker. It is a study in the nude, with no appeal to
    pemmicanised intellects, but there is meaty stuff in it, raw,
    red or underdone.”

The noteworthy features of his life may be stated briefly. He was the
youngest child of a journalist known in the little town of Barnstable,
in Devon, as a shrewd and facile man, and of a timid, pious mother
of the lower middle class. A puny child, backward in development
mentally and physically, solitary, sensitive, shy, secretive, and
self-conscious, he displayed an uncommon interest in nature, birds,
fishes, insects, and all wild creatures. When he was fourteen he
determined to become a naturalist, but his father's illness obliged him
to contribute to the family maintenance. At sixteen he wrote,

    “Signed my death warrant, i.e. my articles apprenticing me to
    journalism for five years. By Jove, I shall work frantically
    during these years so as to be ready at the end of them to take
    up a natural history appointment.”

And work he did, for in little more than a year he was offered a small
appointment at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which he had to refuse
because of his father's complete incapacity. But after another year of
newspaper work and intensive study at night and at odd moments, he won
an appointment in competitive examination to the staff of the Natural
History Museum at South Kensington. There he remained six years, until
July, 1917, when he was compelled to resign owing to the progress
of his disease. In September, 1915, he married, after he had been
declared unfit for military duty and after the secret of his obscure
and baffling disease, and its outcome, had been revealed to some of his
family and to his fiancée.

Two months after he married, despite his infirm state, he offered his
services to his King and Country, having previously obtained from his
own physician a letter addressed to the Medical Officer Examining
Recruits. The recruiting officer promptly rejected him, so the letter
was not presented. On his way home Barbellion opened it and read his
death sentence. “On the whole, I am amazed at the calm way in which I
take this news.” At first he thought he would read up his disease in
some System of Medicine, but the next day he wrote,

    “I have decided never to find out what it is. I shall find out
    in good time by the course of events. A few years ago the news
    would have scared me. But not so now. It only interests me. I
    have been happy, merry, quite high spirited today.”

But this was soon followed by depression and despair, as the progress
of the disease was attested by the occurrence of rapidly increasing
incapacity to get about, to use his arm, and to see. At that time he
was ignorant of the fact that his wife had been informed of the nature
and outcome of his disease previous to their marriage, and he was very
much concerned lest she should find out. Within a year he discovered
that she had known from the beginning and he was “overwhelmed with
feelings of shame and self-contempt and sorrow for her.”

The last months of his life were made as comfortable as possible by
funds subscribed by a few literary men who had become interested in
him from the publication of some chapters of the book in the London
_Mercury_, and by the royalties from the publishers of the “Journal” in
book form.

Barbellion's appearance, as described by his brother A. J., in the
Preface to “The Last Diary,” was striking. He was more than six feet
tall, thin as a rake, and looked like a typical consumptive. His head
was large and crowned with thick brown hair which fell carelessly about
his brow; his face pale and sharply pointed; eyes deepset, lustrous and
wide apart; nose slightly irregular; mouth large and firm; and chin
like a rock. “Few people, except my barber, know how amourous I am.
He has to shave my sinuous lips.” He had an indescribable vividness
of expression, great play of features, and a musical voice. His hands
were strong and sensitive and he had a characteristic habit of beating
the air with them in emphasising an argument. He moved and walked
languidly, like a tired man, and stooped slightly, which gave him an
attitude of studiousness.

Barbellion's fame depends entirely upon “The Journal of a Disappointed
Man.” “Enjoying Life and Other Literary Remains” is commonplace and
might have been done by any one of countless writers whose years
transcend their reputations. “The Last Diary,” on the other hand, has a
note of superficiality which is prejudicial to permanence. It suggests
that it was done for effect and displays studious effort to be wise and
philosophical. Although the book contains many beautiful specimens of
sentiment and shows that Barbellion had enhanced his literary skill
and added to his capacity for expression and sequential statement, it
also shows that the processes of dissolution, physical and mental, were
going on apace.

So much for the outward facts of his life. The value of the record lies
entirely in the sincerity and completeness of the “portrait in the
nude” which the author has painted of himself and which furnishes the
basis for a psychological study of the original.

Three characteristics make the shape and colour of this portrait.
Whether seen in one comprehensive glance as a composite picture, or
subjected to a searching analysis of its separate parts, these three
facts must be reckoned with in any estimate of his life or of his
personality as a whole; or of the smallest act, thought, or emotion
which entered into it. The features or leading motives which shaped the
human study that Barbellion has given us in his diaries are what he
calls ambition to achieve fame, a passion for the study of zoology, and
a struggle against disease.

Every life which raises its possessor above the level of the clod
may be called a battleground. The battle, in Barbellion's case a
hard-fought one, was between ambition which inspired and actuated him
and disease which seriously handicapped him during most of his life and
finally caused his death--not, however, until after the victory had
been won, since the odds were between fame and sickness, not between
life and death. Judged, therefore, solely by the strength of the forces
involved in the conflict and not at all by the value of the stakes,
Barbellion's struggle and early death may claim a little of the glory
suggested in the lines “Oft near the sunset are great battles won.”

That the second motive mentioned, the love of zoology, entered into the
conflict only as an ally, and not even an essential one, of the desire
to become famous, has a special psychological interest. Unquestionable
and persistent as was this passion for the science, it did not seem
to form the basis for his ambition nor even to be inextricably bound
up with it, as is usually the case with persons possessed of one
strongly marked talent or taste combined with a dominant ambition. When
nature has favoured an individual with a gift in the way of desire
and ability to do one thing particularly well he usually concentrates
on it. In fact the desire to achieve success through the talent, and
the impulse for self-expression along the line of the talent, are so
closely related that it is impossible to disentangle them and to say
where the impulse for self-expression ends and the ambition to succeed
begins. Barbellion's diaries, however, present no such difficulty.
Conscious from early childhood of a great attraction to zoology for
the sheer love of the science, his early life-plan naturally took the
form of a career as a zoologist. Thwarted by circumstances, he still
held to the plan with an admirable persistence and a measure of success
which, considering his handicaps in the way of illness and lack of
opportunities for study and training, would have been satisfactory to a
less ambitious man. Such success would not, however, have given him the
fame which it was the ruling motive of his life to achieve. Whether or
not it was the recognition of this that determined the direction of his
ambition it is impossible to say. The fact that stands out with great
clearness, after reading his diaries, is that the consuming passion of
his life was the desire for fame for its own sake, to be known of men,
and to stand out from the mass of humanity as a man of distinction,
a successful man. This seemed to be the full measure of Barbellion's
ambition, and in this he succeeded, since the diaries have made him
famous as the author of a record which shows him to the world as the
winner of a losing game with life, though not as a scientist or as a
writer of distinction.

A closer analysis of the particular qualities of Barbellion's ambition
is the first step in an estimate of his personality.

The urge to keep a journal may come from within or from without the
individual. Barbellion does not tell us which it was with him. In late
childhood he began making frequent records of his doings, which were
those of a lonely romantic child interested in natural history. During
the first three years there is no record of thought, but beginning with
his sixteenth year it makes its appearance, and there is ample evidence
that he was not only mature beyond his years, but ambitious as well. He
says of himself,

    “I was ambitious before I was breeched. I can remember wondering
    as a child if I were a young Macaulay or Ruskin and secretly
    deciding that I was. My infant mind even was bitter with those
    who insisted on regarding me as a normal child and not as a
    prodigy. Since then I have struggled with this canker for many a
    day, and as success fails to arrive it becomes more gnawing.”

That the “canker” was eating its way into his soul as life progressed
and success seemed no nearer from day to day is evidenced by the
statements:

    “I owe neither a knee nor a bare grammercy to any man. All that
    I did I did by my own initiative, save one exception. R. taught
    me to love music.”

    “I am daily facing the fact that my ambitions have overtaxed my
    abilities and health. For years my whole existence has rested on
    a false estimate of my own value, and my life has been revolving
    around a foolish self-deception. And I know myself as I am at
    last and I am not at all enamoured.”

As the “Journal” progresses it becomes evident that the author's hopes
for the realisation of his ambition rested entirely on its publication,
and it is in the expressions concerning his hopes and fears in
connection with the book that the struggle of the soul in its death
grip with advancing disease and threatening failure is most poignantly
expressed. Three years before he died he said,

    “It is the torture of Tantalus to be so uncertain. I should be
    relieved to know even the worst. I would almost gladly burn
    my MSS. in the pleasure of having my curiosity satisfied. I
    go from the nadir of disappointment to the zenith of hope and
    back several times a week, and all the time I am additionally
    harassed by the perfect consciousness that it is all petty and
    pusillanimous to desire to be known and appreciated, that my
    ambition is a morbid diathesis of the mind. I am not such a fool
    either as not to see that there is but little satisfaction in
    posthumous fame, and I am not such a fool as not to realise that
    all fame is fleeting, and that the whole world itself is passing
    away.”

A few months later, after a reference to his infant daughter, he said,

    “If only I could rest assured that after I am dead these
    Journals will be as tenderly cared for--as tenderly as this
    blessed infant! It would be cruel if even after I have paid
    the last penalty, my efforts and sufferings should continue to
    remain unknown or disregarded. What would I give to know the
    effect I shall produce when published! I am tortured by two
    doubts--whether these MSS. (the labour and hope of many years)
    will survive accidental loss and whether they really are of
    value. I have no faith in either.”

Again he wrote:

    “My Journal keeps open house to every kind of happening in
    my soul. Provided it is a veritable autochthon--I don't care
    how much of a taterdemalion or how ugly or repulsive--I take
    him in and--I fear sponge him down with excuses to make him
    more creditable in other's eyes. You may say why trouble
    whether you do or whether you don't tell us all the beastly
    little subterranean atrocities that go on in your mind. Any
    eminently 'right-minded' _Times_ or _Spectator_ reader will
    ask: 'Who in Faith's name is interested in your retrospective
    muck-rakings--in fact, who the Devil are you?' To myself, a
    person of vast importance and vast interest, I reply--as are
    other men if I could but understand them as well. And in the
    firm belief that whatever is inexorably true however unpleasant
    and discreditable (in fact true things can never lack a
    certain dignity), I would have you know Mr. _Times-_ and Mr.
    _Spectator-_ reader that actual crimes have many a time been
    enacted in the secrecy of my own heart and the only difference
    between me and an habitual criminal is that the habitual
    criminal has the courage and the nerve and I have not....”

It is more than probable that the hope of getting the “Journal”
published was suggested by acquaintance with “The Journal of
Marie Bashkirtseff” when Barbellion was twenty-four years old. On
encountering a quotation from her in a book on Strindberg at that time,
he noted,

    “It would be difficult in all the world's history to discover
    any two persons with temperaments so alike. She is the very spit
    of me. We are identical. Oh, Marie Bashkirtseff, how we should
    have hated one another! She feels as I feel. We are of the
    same self-absorption, the same vanity and corroding ambition.
    She is impressionable, volatile, passionate--ill, so am I. Her
    Journal is my Journal. She has written down all my thoughts
    and forestalled me. Is there anything in the transmigration of
    souls? She died in 1886. I was born in 1889.”

Barbellion's own estimate of what he calls his ambition is well summed
up in the following words:

    “My life appears to have been a titanic struggle between
    consuming ambition and adverse fortune. Behold a penniless youth
    thirsting for knowledge introduced into the world out of sheer
    devilment, with a towering ambition, but cursed with ill health
    and a two-fold nature, pleasure loving as well as labour loving.”


It would be interesting to find out in what way he was pleasure loving.
As far as I can see from reading the “Journal,” the only pleasure that
he sought was the occasional pleasure of contemplating nature, which
was really a part of his work, and from hearing music.

    “You can search all history and fiction for an ambition more
    powerful than mine and not find it. No, not Napoleon, nor
    Wilhelm II, nor Keats. No, I am not proud of it, not at all. The
    wonder is that I remain sane, the possessed of such a demon.”

In the same way it is difficult to find evidence of this colossal
ambition, save his statement of it. In reality he was ambitious for one
thing: call it favour, applause, publicity, notoriety, or what not. He
wanted to do something in literature which would focus the vision of
the world upon him, and to accomplish this he devoted an incredible
energy and labour to the production of a diary which was the record of
aggressive, directed, logical thinking. He may have had capacity for
creative literature, or he may have developed such capacity, but he did
not display it. His career can be compared with no other because of
the immeasurable handicap of his illness. But if it were not for this
illness, it would be interesting to compare him with Huysmans, who,
working as a clerk in a Governmental office in Paris, produced a series
of books which gave him a commanding and perhaps a permanent place in
French literature.

Unquestionably some resemblance exists between the passion for fame,
or whatever it may be called, that Barbellion and Marie Bashkirtseff
had in common, although in the case of the latter its relation to a
definite talent was more evident. But that in either of the two cases
it partook in any great measure of the nature of what is generally
understood as ambition--the ambition, for instance, of Napoleon,
Wilhelm II, or Keats to whom Barbellion compares himself--is not
proved by either of their self-revelations. There is a quality well
known to psychologists that may be described as the passion to attract
attention, which is a distinguishing attribute of the neurotic
temperament. It sometimes acts as an urge to the expression of a talent
in case the possessor of the temperament is also the possessor of a
talent--which is by no means infrequent and which was undoubtedly
true in the case of Marie Bashkirtseff. It, however, exists in
innumerable other cases where the neurotic has been gifted by nature
with no special talent or ability for expression of any kind. The mere
reiteration, therefore, of a passion to focus the attention of the
world upon himself, while it would invite questions as to his balance
or the lack of it, affords no proof of mental qualities upon which the
hope of achieving such distinction might reasonably be placed.

The next question which arises in relation to Barbellion's ambition
or desire for distinction is: What were his intellectual possessions?
And the first step in answering this question is the examination of
his interests. By a man's admirations, as by his friends, you may know
him. He identified himself, in a measure, with Keats; he had great
admiration for Sir Thomas Browne; James Joyce was a writer after his
own heart; and he admired Dostoievsky and Francis Thompson.

Barbellion's objective intellect stands out rather clearly in his
record, particularly as the evidence is written more forcibly between
the lines than in his statements. Deduction, induction, and analysis
are rather high. In fact, he possessed wisdom, ingenuity, caution, and
perception; that is, the elements of objective thought. He showed no
great ability to estimate the nature and bearing of his surroundings
or to devise ways of dealing with them so as to turn them to his
advantage, but had it not been for illness he might have done so. As to
the actual results of his intellectual efforts, naturalists say he made
some important contributions to their science; and, although these were
trifling, they were in the right direction. His working life really
ended at twenty-five, an age at which the working life of most men of
science has scarcely begun.

It is almost entirely upon his subjective thought, that is upon his
estimate of himself, that the value of his record rests. Everyone
in his progress through life and his intercourse with his fellows
measures himself more or less deliberately against, and estimates his
own capacity relatively to, theirs, not only with respect to wisdom,
cleverness, or caution, but with respect to special accomplishments.
Besides this relative estimate, he learns to form an absolute estimate
of his intellectual powers. He knows what he can understand at once,
what he has to study hard before he can understand, and what is wholly
beyond his comprehension. Some people habitually underestimate their
ability; others, the majority, overestimate it. It is very difficult
to say, from the literary remains of Barbellion, whether he was of the
latter class or not. He had literary taste, a prodigious appetite,
and he displayed considerable capacity for assimilation. It is
quite possible that, as the result of these, he might have revealed
constructive imagination; but his life was very brief, it was riddled
with illness, and he matured slowly.

Barbellion's estimate of himself may be fairly judged by the epitome
of his whole life which he made in an entry of August 1, 1917, in
connection with his retirement from the staff of the British Museum:

    “I was the ablest junior on the staff and one of the ablest
    zoologists in the place, but my ability was always muffled by
    the inferior work given me to do. My last memoir was the best
    of its kind in treatment, method and technique--not the most
    important--that ever was issued from the institution. It was
    trivial because the work given me was always trivial, the idea
    being that as I had enjoyed no academic career I was unsuited
    to fill other posts then vacant--two requiring laboratory
    training--which were afterwards filled by men of less powers
    than my own. There was also poor equipment for work and I had
    to struggle for success against great odds. In time I should
    have revolutionised the study of Systematic Zoology, and the
    anonymous paper I wrote in conjunction with R. in the _American
    Naturalist_ was a rare _jeu d'esprit_, and my most important
    scientific work. In the literary world I fared no better. I
    first published an article at fifteen, over my father's name. My
    next story was unexpectedly printed in the _Academy_ at the age
    of nineteen. The American _Forum_ published an article, but for
    years I received back rejected manuscript from every conceivable
    kind of publication from _Punch_ to the _Hibbert Journal_.
    Recently, there has been evidence of a more benevolent attitude
    towards me on the part of London editors. A certain magnificent
    quarterly has published one or two of my essays.... I fear,
    however, the flood-tide has come too late.”

In regard to one of the essays, he noted that it called forth
flattering comment in _Public Opinion_, but that it did not impress
anybody else, even E., his wife, who did not read the critique,
although she read twice a pleasant paragraph in the press noticing some
drawings of a friend.

It was one of Barbellion's persecutory ideas that he was not
appreciated at his full value.

    “Ever since I came into the world I have felt an alien in this
    life, a refugee by reason of some prenatal extradiction. I
    always felt alien to my father and mother. I was different from
    them. I knew and was conscious of the detachment. I admired
    my father's courage and happiness of soul, but we were very
    far from one another. I loved my mother, but we had little in
    common.”

When his mother warned him that he was in danger of being friendless
all his life because of his preference for acerbities to amenities he
replied, “I don't want people to like me. I shan't like them. Theirs
will be the greater loss.”

His family feeling seems to have been concentrated largely on his
brother, A. J., who prefixed a brief account of his life and character
to “The Last Diary.”

Of him Barbellion said,

    “He is a most delightful creature and I love him more than
    anyone else in the wide world. There is an almost feminine
    tenderness in my love.”

There were times when, despite his habitual self-appreciation,
Barbellion sold his stock fairly low, and especially after he had been
in London for two or three years and realised what little progress
he was making in the world and how small the orbit of his activity
remained.

    “I have more than a suspicion that I am one of those who grow
    sometimes out of a brilliant boy into a very commonplace man.”

In speaking of his personal appearance he said, “I am not handsome, but
I look interesting, I hope distinguished”; and at another time,

    “If sometimes you saw me in my room by myself, you would say
    that I was a ridiculous coxcomb. For I walk about, look out of
    the window, then at the mirror--turning my head sideways perhaps
    so as to see it in profile. Or I gaze down into my eyes--my eyes
    always impress me--and wonder what effect I produce upon others.
    This, I believe, is not so much vanity as curiosity.”

Naturally Barbellion's estimate of himself and of his potentialities
varied from time to time, but he never rated his abilities lower than
the sum total of his accomplishments would seem to justify, save in
hours of extreme depression and discouragement. When twenty-one years
of age he wrote,

    “Sometimes I think I am going mad. I live for days in the
    mystery and tears of things so that the commonest object, the
    most familiar face--even my own--becomes ghostly, unreal,
    enigmatic. I get into an attitude of almost total scepticism,
    nescience, solipsism even, in a world of dumb, sphinx-like
    things that cannot explain themselves. The discovery of how I am
    situated--a sentient being on a globe in space overshadows me. I
    wish I were just nothing.”

A more hopeful note, and one that is of interest in that it foreshadows
the plan of publication of the diary, is sounded after he had been
working in the museum for less than a year.

    “My own life as it unrolls itself day by day is a source of
    constant amazement, delight and pain. I can think of no more
    interesting volume than a distilled, intimate, psychological
    history of my own life. I want a perfect comprehension at
    least of myself. We are all such egoists that a sorrow
    or hardship--provided it is great enough--flatters our
    self-importance.”

At the age of twenty-five Barbellion had reached the depth of
depression and discouragement.

    “I have peered into every aspect of my life and achievement and
    everything I have seen nauseates me. My life seems to have been
    a wilderness of futile endeavour. I started wrong from the very
    beginning. I came into the world in the wrong place and under
    the wrong conditions. As a boy I was preternaturally absorbed in
    myself and preternaturally discontented. I harassed myself with
    merciless cross examinations.”

A year later he checked up on such moods and said,

    “My sympathy with myself is so unfailing that I don't deserve
    anybody else's. In many respects, however, this Journal I
    believe gives the impression that I behave myself in the public
    gaze much worse than I actually do.”

Man is invariably judged finally by his conduct. Opinion is often
formed of him from what he says, but the last analysis is a review and
estimate of the several activities which together constitute conduct.
Conduct is the pursuit of ends. The conduct that is conditioned by
taking thought does not by any means embrace all one's activities. The
biological discoveries of the latter half of the Nineteenth Century
showed conclusively that the ultimate end to which all life is directed
and toward which every living being strives is the continuation of the
race to which the individual belongs. Life becomes, therefore, a trust,
not a gift, and the only way in which the obligation it entails can
be discharged is by transmitting life to a new generation. Barbellion
had bodily characteristics which permit the biologist to say that his
gonadal redex was dominant, and throughout the diary there are frequent
entries showing that, despite his shyness, self-consciousness, and lack
of “Facility” (using the word in its Scottish sense), the opposite sex
made profound appeal to him. His conduct from early youth would seem to
indicate that he held with the Divine Poet--

  “--In alte dolcezze
  Non si puo gioir, se non amando.”

But his love was evanescent and he was continually asking himself if it
was real or but the figment of desire.

    “To me woman is _the_ wonderful fact of existence. If there be
    any next world and it be as I hope it is, a jolly gossiping
    place with people standing around the mantelpiece and discussing
    their earthly experiences, I shall thump my fist on the table as
    my friends turn to me on entering and exclaim in a loud voice,
    'Woman!'”

Here and there in the “Journal” there are entries which would indicate
that his conduct with women transgressed conventions, though perhaps in
harmony with custom. When he was twenty-five he went to see the “Irish
Play Boy,” and sitting in front of him was a charming little Irish
girl, accompanied by a man whose appearance and manner were repulsive.
He flirted with her successfully. Later, haunted with the desire to
meet her, he sent a personal advertisement to a newspaper hoping that
her eye would encounter it. The advertisement and the money were
returned, as it was suspected that he was a white slave trafficker.
His admiration of the Don Juan type of man is evidenced by an entry in
which he referred to his friendship with a bachelor of sixty, a devotee
of love and strong drink.

    “This man is my devoted friend and truth to tell I get on with
    him better than I do with most people. I like his gamey flavour,
    his utter absence of self-consciousness and his doggy loyalty
    to myself. He may be depraved in his habits, coarse in his
    language, boorish in his manners, ludicrous in the wrongness of
    his views, but I like him just because he is so hopeless. If he
    only dabbled in vice, if he had pale, watery ideas about current
    literature, if he were genteel, I should quarrel.”

The entries that show Barbellion's attitude toward what may be called
the minor activities of social life are illuminating. These are the
latest activities to be acquired and, in a way, testify to or set forth
the individual's development or limitations.

Companionship with one's fellows is necessary to the mental health of
man, and it is of prime necessity that he should secure their good
opinion. The loss of esteem and the knowledge that he is reprobated and
held in contempt and aversion causes a stress that invariably has its
baneful effect, particularly upon a sensitive, self-conscious youth.

Barbellion was the type of individual who sits in ready judgment on
his fellows, and oftentimes his judgment was violently prejudiced. He
had little community feeling. As a youngster he was ostracised by his
school fellows because he was different, and he felt alien. He never
played games with them, but went off on long solitary rambles after
school hours. Nor did he form intimacies with his masters.

    “I presented such an invertebrate, sloppy, characterless
    exterior that no one felt curious enough to probe further into
    my ways of life. It was the same in London. I was alien to my
    colleagues. Among them only R. has ventured to approach my life
    and seek a communion with me. My wife and child seem at a remote
    distance from me.”

In another connection he says,

    “A day spent among my fellows goads me to a frenzy by the
    evening. I am no longer fit for human companionship. People
    string me up to concert pitch. I develop suspicions of one that
    he is prying, or of another that he patronises. Others make
    me horribly anxious to stand well in their eyes and horribly
    curious to know what they think of me. Others I hate and loathe
    for no particular reason. There is a man I am acquainted with
    concerning whom I know nothing at all. I should like to smash
    his face in. I don't know why.”

Barbellion retained many infantile traits in his adult years and these
were displayed in his attitude and conduct toward people.

At twenty-six he said,

    “I have grown so ridiculously hypercritical and fastidious that
    I will refuse a man's invitation to dinner because he has watery
    blue eyes, or hate him for a mannerism or an impediment or
    affectation in his speech. Some poor devil who has not heard of
    Turner or Debussy or Dostoievsky I gird at with the arrogance
    of a knowledgeable youth of seventeen.... I suffer from such a
    savage _amour propre_ that I fear to enter the lists with a man
    I dislike on account of the mental anguish I should suffer if he
    worsted me. I am therefore bottled up so tight--both my hates
    and loves ... if only I had the moral courage to play my part in
    life--to take the stage and be myself, to enjoy the delightful
    sensation of making my presence felt, instead of this vapourish
    mumming. To me self-expression is a necessity of life, and what
    cannot be expressed one way must be expressed in another. When
    colossal egotism is driven underground, whether by a steely
    surface environment or an unworkable temperament or, as in my
    case, by both, you get a truly remarkable pain--the pain one
    might say of continuously unsuccessful attempts at parturition.”

This may seem adorned and artificial, but to me it is the most
illuminating entry in the “Journal” and reveals many of his limitations.

At twenty-eight he made the entry,

    “The men I meet accept me as an entomologist and _ipso facto_,
    an enthusiast in the science. That is all they know of me, and
    all they want to know of me, or of any man. Surely no man's
    existence was ever quite such a duplicity as mine. I smile
    bitterly to myself ten times a day, as I engage in all the
    dreary technical jargon of professional talk with them. How
    they would gossip over the facts of my life if they knew! How
    scandalised they would be over my inner life's activities, how
    resentful of enthusiasm other than entomological!”

It would have contributed to his peace of mind had he studied more
closely the writings of the immortal physician of Norwich, from whom he
believed he had spiritual descent:

    “No man can justly censure or condemn another; because indeed
    no man truly knows another. This I perceive in myself; for I am
    in the dark to all the world; and my nearest friends behold me
    but in a cloud. Those that know me superficially think less
    of me than I do of myself; those of my near acquaintance think
    more; God who truly knows me knows that I am nothing. Further
    no man can judge another, because no man knows himself; for we
    censure others but as they disagree from that humour which we
    fancy laudable in ourselves, and commend others but for that
    wherein they seem to quadrate and consent with us. So that in
    conclusion, all is but that we all condemn, self-love.”

Self-love, or over-appreciation of self, was Barbellion's most serious
stumbling-block. He never got himself in the right perspective
with the world, and it is unlikely, even though his brief life had
been less tragic, that he would have succeeded in doing so. He was
temperamentally unfit.

Barbellion's friends say that he was courteous and soft mannered, but
his own estimate of capacity for display of the amenities is so at
variance with this that we are forced to believe the manner they saw
was veneer.

The following description of Lermontov by Maurice was, he averred, an
exact picture of himself:

    “He had, except for a few intimate friends, an impossible
    temperament; he was proud; overbearing, exasperated and
    exasperating, filled with a savage _amour-propre_, and he took
    a childish delight in annoying; he cultivated 'le plaisir
    aristocratique de deplair.'... He could not bear not to make
    himself felt and if he was unsuccessful in this by fair means he
    resorted to unpleasant ones.”

Two years later he expressed much the same opinion of his social
characteristics when he described himself as something between
a monkey, a chameleon, and a jellyfish and made himself out an
intellectual bully. He was honest enough not to omit an invariable
trait of the bully--cowardice. He says,

    “The humiliating thing is that almost any strong character
    hypnotises me into complacency, especially if he is a
    stranger.... But by Jove, I wreak vengeance on my familiars,
    and on those brethren even weaker than myself. They get my
    concentrated gall, my sulphurous fulminations, and would wonder
    to read this confession.”

In order that any community may exist and thrive each individual
must do things for the common welfare. He must regulate his activity
so as not to impair or jeopardise the property and self-respect of
his neighbours. He must contribute to its existence and development
by an active execution of deeds that draw more closely the bonds of
fellowship and knit more securely the fabric of society. He must
exercise self-restraint in those countless ways by which the conduct
of a person in the presence of others is shorn of indulgences which he
allows himself when alone, and he must perform those ceremonies and
benevolences which constitute politeness and courtesy. The unwritten
law which compels these in order that he may have a reputation for
“normalcy” is even more inexorable than the written law which compels
him to pay taxes and serve on juries and does not permit him to beat
carpets or rugs in the open. Although Barbellion seemed to be very
keen in participating in the defence of the country against external
foes, his diary does not reveal that he had any desire to undertake
municipal, political, or social duties. Illness may explain this, but
illness did not keep him from recording the desire to do so or the
regret that he was prevented from participation in the full life.

Every estimate of Barbellion must take his illness into consideration.
Readily might he subscribe to Sir Thomas Browne's statement, “For the
world, I count it not as an inn, but an hospital; and a place not to
live, but to die in.” In the first entries of the diary he speaks of
being ill, and although the disease of which he died is not habitually
associated with mental or emotional symptoms, it is nevertheless
so horribly incapacitating and is accompanied by such distressing
evidences of disturbed bodily functions that it invariably tinges
the victim's thoughts with despondency and tinctures his emotional
activities with despair.

Barbellion capitalised his infirmity to an extraordinary degree. He
says we are all such egotists that a sorrow or hardship, provided it is
great enough, flatters our self-importance. We feel that a calamity by
overtaking us has distinguished us above our fellows. Were it not for
his illness his book would never have found a publisher, for it is not
a psychological history of his own life--which he believed would make
such an interesting volume--but a Pepysian record of his doings, which,
taken _in toto_, is fairly drab. It was the display of equanimity,
resignation, and courage when confronted with the inevitable, and the
record of his thoughts during that time that give the book its value
and vogue. He was constantly fighting disease and cognisant of his
waning strength.

    “I do not fear ill health in itself, but I do fear its possible
    effect on my mind and character. Already my sympathy with myself
    is maudlin. As long as I have spirit and buoyancy I don't care
    what happens, for I know that so long I cannot be counted a
    failure.”

This is one of the keynotes of his character--that he shall not be
counted a failure. The other--and it is the same--keynote, is that he
shall be a success; that he will make a noise in the world.

The entries after he had got a two-months' sick leave are pathetic. He
was on the point of proposing marriage; he had been to see a well-known
nerve specialist who said that a positive diagnosis could not be made;
he had set out for his holiday at the seaside and had a most depressing
time. When he returned to London he was no better; in fact he was much
worse, and had thoughts of suicide. After he had found out the nature
of his disease he expressed himself with great fortitude, saying,

    “My life has become entirely posthumous. I live now in the grave
    and am busy furnishing it with posthumous joys. I accept my fate
    with great content, my one-time restless ambition lies asleep
    now, my one-time furious self-assertiveness is anæsthetised
    by this great war; the war and the discovery about my health
    together have plucked out of me that canker of self-obsession
    ... for I am almost resigned to the issue in the knowledge that
    some day, someone will know, perhaps somebody will understand
    and--immortal powers!--even sympathise, 'the quick heart
    quickening from the heart that's still.'”

Barbellion's account of his experience with physicians engenders
sadness. He went from general practitioner to chest specialists,
digestion specialists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, without ever
getting the smallest intimation of the nature of his illness, until it
had progressed to an advanced stage. For a long time, indeed, it seemed
to baffle all the physicians who were consulted. One of the distresses
of the diary is that it testifies that doctors are far from omniscient.
Nearly always he was advised to go and live on the prairies; and, like
all sufferers from incurable diseases, the quacks finally got him.

With the spectre of disease always lurking in the background, when
not taking an evident part in the drama of Barbellion's life, it is
inevitable that his attitude toward death should colour his thoughts to
a very marked degree. As early as 1912, when he was twenty-three years
old, he wrote, “As an egoist I hate death because I should cease to be
I”; and the next year,

    “What embitters me is the humiliation of having to die, to
    have to be pouring out the precious juices of my life into
    the dull earth, to be no longer conscious of what goes on, no
    longer moving abroad upon the earth creating attractions and
    repulsions, pouring out one's ego in a stream. To think that the
    women I have loved will be marrying and forget, and that the men
    I have hated will continue on their way and forget I ever hated
    them--the ignominy of being dead!”

If this latter entry had been written a few years later, one might
suspect the influence of Rupert Brooke. As the date stands, one can
only infer that Barbellion, in spite of his much vaunted morbidness,
possessed a little of the zest of life which so richly flavoured the
genius of that young poet.

The entries in the “Journal” after the nature of his disease had been
made known to him express a marked difference in his attitude toward
death. In 1917 he said,

    “I ask myself; what are my views on death, the next world, God?
    I look into my mind and discover I am too much of a mannikin to
    have any. As for death, I am a little bit of trembling jelly of
    anticipation. I am prepared for anything, but I am the complete
    agnostic; I simply don't know. To have views, faith, beliefs,
    one needs a backbone. This great bully of a universe overwhelms
    me. The stars make me cower. I am intimidated by the immensity
    surrounding my own littleness. It is futile and presumptuous
    for me to opine anything about the next world. But I _hope_
    for something much freer and more satisfying after death, for
    emancipation of the spirit and, above all, for the obliteration
    of this puny self, this little, skulking, sharp-witted ferret.”

This, one might almost say, shows Barbellion at his best.

A power of fancy which is displayed in few other connections throughout
the book made him say, during the same year,

    “What a delightful thing the state of death would be if the dead
    passed their time haunting the places they loved in life and
    living over again the dear delightful past--if death were one
    long indulgence in the pleasures of memory! If the disembodied
    spirit forgot all the pains of its previous existence and
    remembered only the happiness! Think of me flitting about the
    orchards and farmyards in----birdnesting, walking along the
    coast among the seabirds, climbing Exmoor, bathing in streams
    and in the sea, haunting all my old loves and passions, cutting
    open with devouring curiosity Rabbits, Pigeons, Frogs, Dogfish,
    Amphioxus; think of me, too, at length unwillingly deflected
    from these cherished pursuits in the raptures of first love,
    cutting her initials on trees and fences instead of watching
    birds, day-dreaming over _Parker and Haswell_ and then bitterly
    reproaching myself later for much loss of precious time. How
    happy I shall be if Death is like this; to be living over again
    and again all my ecstasies, over first times.... My hope is that
    I may haunt these times again, that I may haunt the places, the
    books, the bathes, the walks, the desires, the hopes, the first
    (and last) loves of my life all transfigured and beatified by
    sovereign Memory.”

Nothing in the diaries illustrates more strikingly Barbellion's zest
for living than these allusions to death. In the first decade of life,
the average person gives no thought as to whether he will live or die;
in the second decade he rarely becomes concerned with thoughts of death
unless they are forced upon him by painful or persistent illness. In
the third decade, when the fear of death is very common, Barbellion
knew that he must soon die. This flair for life, which he must have
possessed to a marked degree, is evidenced in his love of nature and in
his appreciation of beauty and of literature to an immensely greater
extent than in contact with his fellows. His pleasure in æsthetics was
real and profound, and included an appreciation of sound, colour, and
form, both in nature and in art. His capacity for the appreciation of
beauty of sound was greater than for the beauty of colour or form.
Although apparently he had never studied music, he said of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony that it “always worked me up into an ecstasy”; and after
listening to music by Tschaikovsky, Debussy, and others that, “I am
chock-full of all this precious stuff and scarcely know what to write.”

Whether or not his suspicion that “my growing appreciation of the
plastic art is with me only distilled sensuality” was true, the
appreciation was unquestionably genuine, as shown by his comment on
Rodin's “The Prodigal Son” that it was “Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
done in stone. It was only on my second visit that I noticed the small
pebble in each hand--a superb touch--what a frenzy of remorse!,” and
on “The Fallen Angel” that “The legs of the woman droop lifelessly
backwards in an intoxicating curve. The eye caresses it--down the
thighs and over the calves to the tips of the toes--like the hind legs
of some beautiful dead gazelle.”

Above his appreciation of æsthetic beauty, however, Barbellion
realised, theoretically at least, that the topmost levels of pleasure
and pain are constituted of qualities dependent upon achievements of
the moral order--of duty well done, of happiness conferred, of services
rendered, of benefits bestowed; or of the antithesis, of remorse for
abstention and neglect of these or for active misdeeds. He says in “The
Last Diary,”

    “Under the lens of scientific analysis natural beauty
    disappears. The emotion of beauty and the spirit of analysis
    and dissection cannot exist contemporaneously. But just as
    man's scientific analysis destroys beauty, so his synthetic
    art creates it. And man creates beauty, nature supplying the
    raw materials. Because there is beauty in man's own heart, he
    naïvely assumes its possession by others and so projects it into
    nature. But he sees in her only the truth and goodness that are
    in himself. Natural beauty is everyone's mirror.”

Barbellion's strong sense of moral values was always coloured by his
passion--which was almost a mania for receiving appreciation and
applause. Although he denied wanting to be liked, respected, and
admired, yet he clamoured for it. He displayed pain upon receiving the
marks of disapprobation, and reproof he disliked and despised.

He was singularly free from spontaneous disorder of will; that is, of
delay, vacillation, and precipitation. The only evidence he gave of
vacillation was about his marriage, and that showed his good judgment.
He was much more inclined to precipitation than to vacillation, and
for a neurotic individual he was strangely without obsession--that
is the morbid desire to do some act which the would-be performer
discountenances and struggles not to do.

With all his sensitiveness, Barbellion seemed to have been not
without an element of cruelty. This was of the refined, indirect sort
and was chiefly noticeable in references to his wife. While he was
contemplating a proposal of marriage he made an entry in his diary,

    “I tried my best, I have sought every loophole of escape, but
    I am quite unable to avoid the melancholy fact that her thumbs
    are lamentable. Poor dear, how I love her! That is why I am so
    concerned about her thumbs.”

In speaking of his fiancée's letters, he once wrote,

    “These letters chilled me. In reply I wrote with cold steel
    short, lifeless, formal notes, for I felt genuinely aggrieved
    that she should care so little how she wrote to me or how she
    expressed her love. I became ironical with myself over the
    prospect of marrying a girl who appeared so little to appreciate
    my education and mental habits.”

Two years later he added to this entry “What a popinjay!” But then
two years later he was a confirmed invalid and she was making great
sacrifice to take care of him.

In another place he taunted her, after admitting her letters
disappointed him with their coldness, and added, “Write as you would
speak. You know I am not one to carp about a spelling mistake”; and at
another time he recorded,

    “My life here has quite changed its orientation. I am no longer
    an intellectual snob. If I were E. and I would have parted ere
    now. I never like to take her to the British Museum because
    there all the values are intellectual.”

Of his wife the diaries give a very vague picture. Once he exclaimed,
“To think that she of all women, with a past such as hers, should be
swept into my vicious orbit!” but no information is given regarding
this past. The idea of marriage was in his thoughts for several years,
but his attitude was one of doubt and vacillation. In 1914 he wrote:

    “I wish I loved more steadily. I am always sidetracking myself.
    The title of 'husband' scares me.”

When he finally recorded his marriage as having taken place at the
Registry Office he added,

    “It is impossible to set down here all the labyrinthine ambages
    of my will and feelings in regard to this event. Such incredible
    vacillations, doubts and fears.”

“The function of the private journal is one of observation, experiment,
analysis, contemplation; the function of the essay is to provoke
reflection,” wrote Amiel. Barbellion's observation was of himself and
of nature; his experiment how to adjust himself to the world; his
analysis almost exclusively of his ego; and his contemplation the
mystery of life and death. A “sport” in the biological sense, that
is, differing markedly from his immediate ancestors, he fell afoul of
infection early in life. From the beginning it scarred and debilitated
him.

He was an egotist and proud of it. He did not realise that the ego
is a wall which limits the view rising higher with every emotional
or intellectual growth. There is a certain degree of greatness from
which, when a man reaches it, he can always look over the top of the
wall of his egotism. Barbellion never reached it. He was a man above
the ordinary, capable of originality and of learning from experience,
clever at his profession, apt at forming general ideas, sometimes
refined and sometimes gross; a solitary, full of contradictions, ironic
or ingenuous by fits, tormented by sexual images and sentimental ideas,
and possessed by the desire to become famous, but haunted by the fear
that he would not live to see his desire accomplished.

He had the misfortune to be without faith or ability to acquire it, but
in compensation he was given to an envious degree immunity to fear, and
he endured disease and faced death with courage and resignation. If we
contrast his thought and conduct with that of another egotist, Robert
Louis Stevenson, after he came to know the number of days that remained
for him, as thought and conduct are recorded in the “Vailima Letters,”
Barbellion suffers from the comparison, for Stevenson was devoid of
vanity and selfishness. But the comparison would not be a just one, for
euphoria is a feature of the disease with which Stevenson contended,
and despair of Barbellion's. Moreover, Stevenson was a Celt and had
a sense of humour. Everyone likes to think that his distinguishing
characteristic is a sense of humour. Barbellion believed he possessed
it tremendously. He may have, but his books do not reveal it.

He forced himself without academic training upon a most conservative
institution, a close corporation, archaically conventionalised, and he
gave earnest that he could mount the ladder of preferment quickly and
gracefully.

He saw himself with the lucidity of genius, but his admirers will not
admit that he was the man he said he was. One admirer does.

Would that he had added to his litany: _Defenda me, Dios, de me!_--The
Lord deliver me from myself. Had he done so, he would have accomplished
to a greater degree the object of life: to be happy and to make others
happy.




                              CHAPTER IX
          THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DIARIST: HENRI-FRÉDÉRIC AMIEL

    “True serenity does not consist in indifference to the phenomena
    of life amongst which we live. It consists of judging in an
    elevated way men and facts. True serenity does not reign
    apart from life. It is in the land of the hurricane that it
    is a grand virtue to know how to remain calm. Possibly he who
    can accomplish this will succeed in avoiding its perils, or
    surmounting its consequences. Perhaps it is better to lose
    one's foothold in the waves than it is to prosper in a solitude
    without echo. Only solitude that has been wrought from the
    tumult is precious.”--GEORGES DUHAMEL.


No brief statement ever made applies more fittingly to Henri-Frédéric
Amiel--more widely known now, one hundred years after his birth, than
during his lifetime--than these words of one of the most promising
young men of letters of France.

Amiel says in his “Journal Intime”:

    “There remains the question whether the greatest problems which
    have ever been guessed on earth had not better have remained
    buried in the brain which found the key to them, and whether the
    deepest thinkers--those whose hand has been boldest in drawing
    aside the veil, and their eye keenest in fathoming the mystery
    beyond it--had not better, like the prophet of Iliom, have kept
    for Heaven, and for Heaven alone, secrets and mysteries which
    human language cannot truly express nor human intelligence
    conceive.”

                   *       *       *       *       *

    “To win true peace, a man needs to feel himself directed,
    pardoned, and sustained by a supreme power, to feel himself in
    the right road, at the point where God would have him be--in
    order with God and the universe. This faith gives strength and
    calm. I have not got it. All that is, seems to me arbitrary and
    fortuitous. It may as well not be, as be. Nothing in my own
    circumstances seems to me providential. All appears to me left
    to my own responsibility, and it is this thought which disgusts
    me with the government of my own life. I longed to give myself
    up wholly to some great love, some noble end; I would willingly
    have lived and died for the ideal--that is to say, for a holy
    cause. But once the impossibility of this made clear to me, I
    have never since taken a serious interest in anything, and have,
    as it were, but amused myself with a destiny of which I was no
    longer the dupe.”

                 *       *       *       *       *

    “There is a great affinity in me with the Hindoo genius--that
    mind, vast, imaginative, loving, dreamy, and speculative, but
    destitute of ambition, personality, and will. Pantheistic
    disinterestedness, the effacement of the self in the great
    whole, womanish gentleness, a horror of slaughter, antipathy
    to action--these are all present in my nature, in the nature
    at least which has been developed by years and circumstances.
    Still the West has also had its part in me. What I have found
    difficult is to keep up a prejudice in favour of any form,
    nationality, or individuality whatever. Hence my indifference
    to my own person, my own usefulness, interest, or opinions
    of the moment. What does it all matter? _Omnis determinatio
    est negatio._ Grief localises us, love particularises us, but
    thought delivers us from personality.... To be a man is a poor
    thing, to be a man is well; to be _the_ man--man in essence and
    in principle--that alone is to be desired.” (Written at the age
    of fifty-four.)

The “Journal Intime,” upon which alone Amiel's fame rests, is studded
with such expressions, all of which go to prove that he was handicapped
with an inability to participate in life. One may call it aboulia,
or lack of will power; but it was not lack of will power. That the
intellect which could produce such work was not directed into some
practical channel during a long and healthy life naturally arouses a
question; and this question has been answered by Amiel's admirers and
his critics in various ways. The only conclusion, however, to which
an unbiassed examination of his life and of his book can lead is the
simple one that Amiel was born that way, just as some people are
born Albinos, or, to put it in other words, that he was temperamentally
unfit for practical life.

[Illustration: HENRI-FRÉDÉRIC AMIEL]

Henri-Frédéric Amiel was born in Geneva September 27, 1821, and died
there March 11, 1881. His ancestors were Huguenots who sought refuge in
Switzerland after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. There is no
record that any of them achieved greatness or had greatness thrust upon
them. Very little has been written of his parents, who died when he
was twelve years old, or of his uncle and aunt, in whose house he was
brought up apart from his two sisters. All those who have written about
Amiel himself are singularly silent about his boyhood, so that we know
practically nothing of the formative years of his life save that he was
a sensitive, impressionable boy, more delicate than robust, disposed to
melancholy, and with a deep interest in religious problems. In school
and college he was studious but not brilliant; he had no interest in
games or sports and made few intimacies, and these with men older
than himself. When he was nineteen he came under the influence of a
Genevan philologist and man of letters, Adolphe Picquet, whose lectures
answered many a positive question and satisfied many a vague aspiration
of this youth already in the meshes of mysticism. They exercised a
decisive influence over his thought, filled him with fresh intuitions,
and brought near to him the horizons of his dreams.

When he was twenty he went to Italy and stayed more than a year, and
while there he wrote several articles on Christian Art, and a criticism
of a book by M. Rio. The next four years he spent in Germany, where
he studied philosophy, philology, mythology, and history. After this
he travelled about the university cities of Central Europe for two
years, principally Heidelberg, Munich, and Vienna; and in 1849, when
he was twenty-eight years old, he returned to Geneva and secured the
appointment of Professor of Moral Philosophy in the Academy there.
The appointment was made by the Democratic Party, which had just
then come into control of the Government. The Aristocratic Party,
which had had things their own way since the days following the
restoration of Geneva's independence in 1814, would have nothing to do
with intellectual upstarts, puppets of the Radical Party, so Amiel,
by nature and conviction a conservative, found himself in the right
pew, but the wrong church; and many of his friends thought that the
discouragement which was manifest in his writings and in his conduct
may, in a measure at least, have been due to the conflict between his
discomfiture and his duty.

He had few friends, but these he impressed enormously by his learning
and his knowledge. He made no particular reputation as a professor
or as a poet, and had it not been for the “Journal,” he would never
have been heard of save by his friends and pupils. It is now forty
years since the first volume of the book was published at Geneva. It
had been put together from the thousands of sheets of diary which
had come into the hands of his literary heirs. The Preface to the
volume announced that this “Journal” was made up of his psychological
observations and impressions produced on him by books. It was the
confidant of his private and intimate thoughts; a means whereby
the thinker became conscious of his own inner life; a safe shelter
wherein his questionings of fate and future, the voice of grief, of
self-examination and confession, the soul's cry for inward peace might
make themselves freely heard.

It made a great noise in the world and the reverberations of it will
not cease.

Some consider that the “Journal Intime” occupies a unique place in
literature, not because it is a diary of introspection, but because
of the tragedy which attended its production. This is the height of
absurdity. There was no tragedy about its production. Amiel lived an
unhealthy life, thwarted nature's laws, and nature exacted the penalty.
N. J. Symons, in an article in the _Queen's Quarterly_, says, “To
be gifted with the qualities of genius, yet to be condemned by some
obscure psychosis to perpetual sterility and failure; to live and
die in the despairing recognition of this fact; and finally to win
posthumous fame by the analysis and confession of one's failure is one
of the most puzzling and pathetic of life's anomalies.” It would be if
it were true. But what were the qualities of genius that Amiel had? And
how did he display the obscure psychosis? He discharged the duties of
a professor from the time he was twenty-eight until he was sixty. He
poetised pleasantly; he communed with nature and got much pleasure from
it; and he had very definite social adaptability. His general level of
behaviour was high. He was a diligent, methodical worker; he reacted
in a normal way to conventional standards; he had few personal biases
or peculiarities and none that drew particular attention to him; and
he seemed to have adjusted himself without great difficulty to the
incidences of life that he encountered.

To say that such a man was the victim of some obscure psychosis is
either to speak beyond the facts or to speak from the possession of
some knowledge that is denied one familiar with his writings and what
has been written about him.

Unique the “Journal Intime” unquestionably is, in that it is the
sincere confession of failure, both as a man and as a writer, of a
man whose intellectual qualities justified his friends in expecting
from him a large measure of success as both. Both admirers and critics
agree that Amiel's failure was his refusal or his inability to act.
This refusal to act was not the expression of some obscure psychosis,
but was entirely consistent with his philosophy of life, which was
arrived at through a logical process of thought. “Men's thoughts are
made according to their nature,” says Bacon. It is to Amiel's nature,
or temperament, or personality, that we must look for the answer to the
question: To what can his confessed failure be charged?

Any estimate of personality must weigh not only the capacity for
dealing with thoughts, but the capacity for dealing with men and with
things as well. Intellectual qualities are of value only in relation
to the dynamic quality of the mind; emotional qualities must be
measured by the reactions to the environment; and the individual, in
the last analysis, must take his standing among his fellows upon his
acts, not upon his thoughts. In a balanced personality act harmonises
with thought, is conditioned and controlled by it. Purely impulsive
action carried to the extreme means insanity, and in milder degrees
it exhibits itself in all grades and forms of what is known as lack
of self-control. Such action is too familiar to call for comment.
But there is the opposite type of individual whose impulses are not
impelling enough to lead to expression in outward form of either
thoughts or emotions. Such thoughts and emotions are turned back
upon themselves and, like a dammed-up stream, whirl endlessly around
the spring, the ego, until the individual becomes predominantly
introspective and egocentric.

Amiel possessed the power of clear logical thought to a high degree,
but he limited its expression largely to the introspective musings of
the diary. Aside from his daily life, which was narrow but normal and
conventional, it is to Amiel's deepest interests and admirations as
revealed by his diary that one must look for light upon his emotional
make-up. The things with which he occupied himself were extremely few:
introspective literature, philosophy and religion, and contemplation
of God and the hereafter. The diary covers the years of his life from
twenty-seven to sixty, the entire fruitful span of most men's lives.
During all of this time his interests showed little or no variation.
Nowhere throughout the record do we find any evidence of interest in
the developments which were shaping the course of the world's history.
Still less do we find any indication of a desire or a conscience
to participate in such history. Amiel evidently felt no urge to be
an actor in the drama. He was not even a critic or an interested
on-looker. Rather did he prefer to withdraw to a sheltered distance
and forget the reverberations of the struggle in contemplation of
abstractions.

He lived in an era in which the world was revolutionised. The most
deforming institution which civilisation has ever tolerated, slavery,
was razed and dismantled; yet he never said a word about it. He was
a witness of one of the greatest transformations that has ever been
wrought, the making of things by machinery rather than by hand; and he
never commented on it. His life was contemporaneous with the beginning
of discovery in science, such as the origin of species and the general
evolutionary doctrine associated with Darwin's name; and it seems only
to have excited his scorn.

    “The growing triumph of Darwinism--that is to say of
    materialism, or of force--threatens the conception of justice.
    But justice will have its turn. The higher human law cannot be
    the offspring of animality. Justice is the right to the maximum
    of individual independence compatible with the same liberty
    for others;--in other words, it is respect for man, for the
    immature, the small, the feeble; it is the guarantee of those
    human collectivities, associations, states, nationalities--those
    voluntary or involuntary unions--the object of which is to
    increase the sum of happiness, and to satisfy the aspiration
    of the individual. That some should make use of others for
    their own purposes is an injury to justice. The right of the
    stronger is not a right, but a simple fact, which obtains only
    so long as there is neither protest nor resistance. It is like
    cold, darkness, weight, which tyrannise over man until he has
    invented artificial warmth, artificial light, and machinery.
    Human industry is throughout an emancipation from brute
    nature, and the advances made by justice are in the same way a
    series of rebuffs inflicted upon the tyranny of the stronger.
    As the medical art consists in the conquest of disease, so
    goodness consists in the conquest of the blind ferocities and
    untamed appetites of the human animal. I see the same law
    throughout:--increasing emancipation of the individual, a
    continuous ascent of being towards life, happiness, justice,
    and wisdom. Greed and gluttony are the starting-point,
    intelligence and generosity the goal.”

Nor is there anything in the “Journal Intime” to indicate that he had
ever heard of Pasteur, or Morton, or Simpson, who laid the foundation
of a diseaseless world and a painless world. His diary is a record of
his own thoughts, to be sure, but one's thoughts are engendered, in a
measure at least, by what is going on in the world. An inhabitant of
any other world whose knowledge of this could be obtained only from
Amiel's book, would be left with an abysmal ignorance of the subject.
He would learn something of the German philosophers and of French
littérateurs and of Amiel's ideas of God and of infinity.

Schopenhauer says that

    “It is not by the unification of the intellect and the will that
    man attains to higher truth, but by their dissociation. When
    the intellect casts off the yoke of the will it rises above the
    illusion of finite life and attains a vision of transcendent
    truth. When one can contemplate without will, beyond, when
    he can dissolve the life instinct in pure thought, then he
    possesses the field of higher truth, then he is on the avenue
    that leads to Nirvana.”

Higher truth is possible only through the annihilation of the will,
and if this annihilation is done after taking thought, that is after
planning to do it and determining to do it, the price that one has to
pay, or the penalty that is exacted, is an incapacity or diminished
capacity for practical life. Amiel was a real mystic, not by choice,
perhaps, but by birth. He was proud of it in his youth and early
maturity; he questioned it in his late maturity; and regretted it in
his senescence. When he was fifty years old he wrote,

    “The man who gives himself to contemplation looks on at rather
    than directs his life, is a spectator rather than an actor,
    seeks rather to understand than to achieve. Is this mode of
    existence illegitimate, immoral? Is one bound to act? Is such
    detachment an idiosyncrasy to be respected or a sin to be
    fought against? I have always hesitated on this point, and I
    have wasted years in futile self-reproach and useless fits
    of activity. My western conscience, penetrated as it is with
    Christian morality, has always persecuted my Oriental quietism
    and Buddhist tendencies. I have not dared to approve myself, I
    have not known how to correct myself.... Having early caught
    a glimpse of the absolute, I have never had the indiscreet
    effrontery of individualism. What right have I to make a merit
    of a defect? I have never been able to see any necessity for
    imposing myself upon others, nor for succeeding. I have seen
    nothing clearly except my own deficiencies and the superiority
    of others.... With varied aptitudes and a fair intelligence, I
    had no dominant tendency, no imperious faculty, so that while
    by virtue of capacity I felt myself free, yet when free I could
    not discover what was best. Equilibrium produced indecision and
    indecision has rendered all my faculties barren.”

If Amiel had been a real Christian, that is, if he had taken his
orientation and orders from Christ, he would have had no doubt whether
such a mode of existence was illegitimate and immoral or not. He could
have found specific instruction telling him he was bound to act. He was
a nominal Christian, but a _de facto_ Buddhist.

Next to the output of a man's activity as shown by his work,
his selection of recreational outlets for his emotional life is
illuminating. What were Amiel's amusements? So far as the diary shows,
day dreaming, poetising, fancy, and a contemplation of nature furnished
the only outlets for his more organised emotional nature. For play in
any form he apparently felt no need.

There is a type of individual whose failure to bring his performance up
to the standard which his intelligence would seem to warrant takes the
form of inability to face concrete situations. Unable to adjust himself
to his environment when realities present difficulties that call for
solution, such an individual becomes burdened with a sense of his own
inadequacy; and from this he is inclined to seek escape in impersonal
abstractions, usually described by him as ideals. Mystic philosophy in
some form is the frequent refuge of such tender souls from their own
sense of inability to cope with life and its concrete problems.

Throughout the record divergence between ideals and acts stands out.
Idealism is everywhere pled as the basis of the hesitation to act. The
conscious and foredoomed disparity between conception and realisation
is made the excuse for the absence of effort.

    “Practical life makes me afraid. And yet, at the same time, it
    attracts me; I have need of it. Family life, especially, in
    all its delightfulness, in all its moral depth, appeals to me
    like a duty. Sometimes I cannot escape from the ideal of it. A
    companion of my life, of my work, of my thoughts, of my hopes;
    within, a common worship, towards the world outside, kindness
    and beneficence; educations to undertake, the thousand and one
    moral relations which develop round the first--all these ideas
    intoxicate me sometimes. But I put them aside, because every
    hope is, as it were, an egg whence a serpent may issue instead
    of a dove, because every joy missed is a stab, because every
    seed confided to destiny contains an ear of grief which the
    future may develop.”

                   *       *       *       *       *

    “I have never felt any inward assurance of genius, or any
    presentiment of glory or happiness. I have never seen myself
    in imagination great or famous, or even a husband, a father,
    an influential citizen. This indifference to the future, this
    absolute self-distrust, are, no doubt, to be taken as signs.
    What dreams I have are vague and indefinite; I ought not to
    live, for I am now scarcely capable of living.--Recognise your
    place; let the living live; and you, gather together your
    thoughts, leave behind you a legacy of feeling and ideas; you
    will be more useful so. Renounce yourself, accept the cup given
    you, with its honey and its gall, as it comes. Bring God down
    into your heart. Embalm your soul in him now, make within you
    a temple for the Holy Spirit; be diligent in good works, make
    others happier and better. Put personal ambition away from
    you, and then you will find consolation in living or in dying,
    whatever may happen to you.”

Complaining of a restless feeling which was not the need for change, he
said,

    “It is rather the fear of what I love, the mistrust of what
    charms me, the unrest of happiness.... And is there not another
    reason for all this restlessness, in a certain sense of void--of
    incessant pursuit of something wanting?--of longing for a truer
    peace and a more entire satisfaction? Neighbours, friends,
    relations--I love them all; and so long as these affections are
    active, they leave in me no room for a sense of want. But yet
    they do not _fill_ my heart; and that is why they have no power
    to fix it. I am always waiting for the woman and the work which
    shall be capable of taking entire possession of my soul, and of
    becoming my end and aim.”

Amiel's life was a constant negation. His ideals were all concerned
with concepts of perfection, with the absolute, and being sane enough
to realise the impossibility of attaining such perfection, he refused
compromises. He would not play the game for its own sake, nor for the
fine points. If he could not win all the points--and being sane he knew
beforehand that he could not--he preferred not to play at all. But he
made a virtue of his weakness and called it idealism. Had he possessed
the courage to hitch his wagon to a star--and let the star carry him
where it would; had he heeded the warning,

  “And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost
  Is--the unlit lamp and the ungird loin”;

or gone the way of thousands of practical idealists who have made their
idealism an incentive to action and thereby left the world richer
for having passed through it, he would have needed no excuse for his
failure to attain perfection. On the contrary, he would have learned
with the sureness of a hard-learned lesson that idealism is worth our
loyalty only when it becomes an inspiration to living, and that it is
worse than futile when it serves merely as a standard for thought or an
excuse for failure.

Amiel coddled his sensibilities for fear of rebuff; he hid his
intellectuality in the diary lest he should suffer from the clear
light of publicity; he denied life out of apprehension that life might
bruise his ego. He told himself that he was protecting his idealism. In
reality he was protecting his egoism. If he had been the victim of a
psychosis he would not have recognised his limitations nor stated them
so clearly. It was sanity that enabled him to see the impossibility
of attaining the perfection of which he dreamed and wrote. It was
cowardice, not a psychosis, which made him refuse to act in the face of
this knowledge. Had he been a Roman Catholic, he might have rested upon
the conception of absolute perfection offered in the authority of the
Church and the life of the cloister. But being a Protestant, both by
inheritance and by conscience, he had to think things out for himself;
and the more he thought the wider became the breach between his
conception of perfection and his hope of realising it. He was tortured
by a conscience goading him to action and a temperament paralysing him
with the fear that the end would fall short of anticipation. He lacked
the moral courage to put his power to the test and be disappointed. He
was without the stamina of the man who fights and runs away. He was too
much of an egoist to risk a losing game, and in consequence he never
tasted the sweet flavour of work well done--even though the end was
apparent failure.

The growing sense of inadequacy between the conscience to act and
the temperament to deny action is written plainly in these random
quotations from the “Journal” during the record of many years. At
thirty he wrote,

    “He who is silent is forgotten; he who abstains is taken at
    his word; he who does not advance, falls back; he who stops is
    overwhelmed, distanced, crushed; he who ceases to grow greater
    becomes smaller; he who leaves off gives up; the stationary
    condition is the beginning of the end--it is the terrible
    symptom which precedes death. To live, is to achieve a perpetual
    triumph; it is to assert oneself against destruction, against
    sickness, against the annulling and dispersion of one's physical
    and moral being. It is to will without ceasing, or rather to
    refresh one's will day by day.”

Ten years later when the conflict was closing in upon him he wrote,

    “In me an intellect which would fain forget itself in things, is
    contradicted by a heart which yearns to live in human beings.
    The uniting link of the two contradictions is the tendency
    towards self-abandonment, towards ceasing to will and exist
    for oneself, towards laying down one's own personality, and
    losing--dissolving--oneself in love and anticipation. What I
    lack above all things is character, will, individuality. But, as
    always happens, the appearance is exactly the contrary of the
    reality, and my outward life the reverse of my true and deepest
    aspiration. I whose whole being--heart and intellect--thirsts to
    absorb itself in reality, in its neighbour man, in Nature and in
    God--I, whom solitude devours and destroys--I shut myself up in
    solitude and seem to delight only in myself and to be sufficient
    for myself.”

At forty-seven, when most men's work is at the high tide of
realisation, he said,

    “I have no more strength left, I wish for nothing; but that
    is not what is wanted. I must wish what God wishes; I must
    pass from indifference to sacrifice, and from sacrifice to
    self-devotion. The cup I would fain put away from me is the
    misery of living, the shame of existing and suffering as a
    common creature who has missed his vocation; it is the bitter
    and increasing humiliation of declining power, of growing
    old under the weight of one's own disapproval, and the
    disappointment of one's friends.”

At fifty-four,

    “What use have I made of my gifts, of my special circumstances,
    of my half century of existence? What have I paid back to my
    country?... Are all the documents I have produced ... anything
    better than withered leaves?... When all is added up--nothing!
    And worst of all, it has not been a life used up in the service
    of some adored object, or sacrificed to any future hope.”

Psychology teaches that too much emphasis cannot be laid in education
upon the reconciliation of ideals and performance, nor too much effort
devoted to the formation of habits of facing concrete situations
squarely, reaching definite decisions, and thereby making efforts,
however ineffective and crude, to link ideals to action. It has been
proved that if natural dispositions are ignored or denied by the
repression of normal primary instincts, disassociation of personality
is likely to be the result. Amiel's ineffectiveness, his lack of
dynamic quality, while in no sense a psychosis, may be considered as
a personality defect. How far this defect may have been conditioned
by his denial of the basic springs of human action cannot be stated.
Neither can it, in any impartial estimate of his life and personality,
be ignored. Next to the instinct of self-preservation, the instinct
for the preservation of the race to which one belongs is the dominant
impulse of the individual. No system of thought, no plan of life can
ignore it and not pay the penalty. Amiel's diary is full of such
denials, and they frequently carry with them the consciousness that he
realised the death sentence to aspiration and realisation which he was
reading to himself between the lines.

Amiel was a shy, sensitive, solitary child. We know very little about
his adolescent struggles and transition to heterosexual fixation.
Indeed we do not know whether it ever came about, and that is where
the chief hiatus in our knowledge of Amiel lies. As a youth he became
intoxicated with philosophic idealism, and Hegel was for him the
fountainhead of all philosophic thought.

There is nothing in the diary to indicate that the normal love-making
of healthy youth had any part in his thoughts or his life. Later,
his sex consciousness colours the record to a great extent--indeed it
might be said to give the colour to the book--but always in the guise
of repressions, fears, hesitations, and longings for unattainable
perfection, and finally of half-hearted regrets for his own denials.

    “I am capable of all the passions, for I bear them all within
    me. Like a tamer of wild beasts, I keep them caged and lassoed,
    but I sometimes hear them growling. I have stifled more than one
    nascent love. Why? Because with that prophetic certainty which
    belongs to moral intuition, I felt it lacking in true life, and
    less durable than myself. I choked it down in the name of the
    supreme affection to come. The loves of sense, of imagination,
    of sentiment--I have seen through and rejected them all; I
    sought the love which springs from the central profundities of
    being. And I still believe in it. I will have none of those
    passions of straw which dazzle, burn up, and wither; I invoke,
    I await, and I hope for the love which is great, pure, and
    earnest, which lives and works in all the fibres and through
    all the powers of the soul. And even if I go lonely to the end,
    I would rather my hope and my dream died with me, than that my
    soul should content itself with any meaner union.”

This is the basis of monasticism in the Catholic Church, and it is, in
my judgment, the most violent offence to God that can be given. Goethe
says that he never wrote a new poem without having a new love affair.
Amiel was intrigued by Goethe secondly only to Hegel. If he had copied
Goethe more nearly in living, he might have said with him,

  “Wonach soll man am Ende trachten?
  Die Welt zu Kennen und nicht zu Verachten.”

There have been books made up of beautiful quotations from Amiel's
“Journal Intime,” which are supposed to help people live, to mitigate
pain, to disperse apprehension, and to assuage misery. They are not a
patch on the Bible or on the writings of Socrates.

“The oracle of today drops from his tripod on the morrow,” said John
Morley. Will this apply to Amiel? Is he a passing fashion? And why
has his popularity grown? The best answer to these questions is found
in the nature of his audience. To what kind of people does Amiel
appeal? To the contemporary purveyors of cloudy stuff; to mystics;
to the tender-minded; to those who prefer the contemplation of far
horizons to travelling the road just ahead. He does not appeal to
anyone with fighting blood, whether he be facing the conflict with the
glorious self-confidence of healthy untried youth, the magnetism of
past success, the tried measure of his own limitations and powers, the
scars of honest defeat, or the pluck of the one who fights a losing
fight with more courage and idealism than he would have mustered for a
winning one.

Amiel's tragedy was that he outraged nature's unique law and nature
exacted the penalty. If the world had a few thousand Amiels and they
got the whip hand, it might cease to exist.




                               CHAPTER X
            GEORGES DUHAMEL: POET, PACIFIST, AND PHYSICIAN


The world is thronged with people who are busying themselves with
world ordering. They may be divided into two great groups: those who
believe that it is to be brought about by revolution; and those who are
convinced that it is to be accomplished by following the instructions
given by the Master to the lawyer who asked the question: “Which is
_the_ great commandment in the law?” The former are called Bolshevists;
the latter Pacifists; and both terms are habitually used derisively.
Amongst the latter there are few more conspicuous in France than
Georges Duhamel, a physician by profession, a littérateur by choice,
who at thirty-eight years of age finds himself in a commanding position
in French letters.

I have recently had the opportunity of an interview with this brilliant
young man, and it occurs to me to present a summary of his aspirations
and an estimate of his accomplishments.

His history is brief. Early success, like a happy country, does not
furnish history. He was born in Paris in 1884, the son of a physician
and the grandson of a farmer. This evolution from farmer to littérateur
in three generations Duhamel says is common in France, indeed in all
Central Europe. His tastes seem to have been largely influenced, if
not formed, by the setting and atmosphere with which his father's
profession surrounded his early life. Until he was mobilised in 1914
Duhamel had not practised medicine. Even as a youth he had experienced
the literary urge and felt that he would eventually succumb to it. He,
however, devoted himself to the sciences and to medicine in the firm
belief that such study provides the best preparation for the vocation
of literature. In this M. Duhamel is in full accord with another famous
theoretical world orderer, Mr. H. G. Wells, but in disagreement with a
practical one, Mr. Charles E. Hughes.

“One does not learn life from letters, but from life, through seeing
suffering and death,” said he when asked to speak of the factors that
influenced him to abandon medicine for letters.

In the midst of his studies as a youth he had what he now calls rather
a strange adventure.

    “I spent much time in the society of friends: writers, painters
    and sculptors. All of us were seized with a strong desire to
    shrink from society as it was constituted. Although we were not
    all Fourierites, we decided to form a phalanstery in which we
    could live a community life, each one taking part in the work
    and in the joy of living in an atmosphere adapted to our tastes
    and our professions. We agreed to make our living by means of
    manual work, and to abolish the relation of master and servant.
    We decided to adopt the trade of typography, which would permit
    us to advance our art. Through mutual economies we bought a
    printing press and our first books were published by 'L'Abbaye
    de Creteil,' as our little publishing house was called. The
    phalanstery was disbanded for financial reasons, but we had a
    taste of an agreeable life, independent, oftentimes difficult,
    but in many respects quite ideal.”

When asked about his earliest literary productions and why he essayed
poetry rather than prose, he replied,

    “Generally speaking, all writers begin with poetry and gradually
    forsake metre. Our little group wanted to initiate a great
    literary epoch and we believed that this could be done only by
    creating an atmosphere favourable to intellectual work.”

He might have borrowed Socrates' reply when Cebes asked the same
question: “For I reflect that a man who means to be a poet has to use
fiction and not facts for his poems.” M. Duhamel's training had been in
facts, and his greatest success in letters has been in the recording
of facts. His smallest success has been in establishing postulates
based upon them.

[Illustration: GEORGES DUHAMEL] From a drawing by _Ivan Opffer_ in _THE
BOOKMAN._

In 1909 M. Duhamel received his degree in medicine and shortly after
appeared the four plays which, with his poetry, “Des Légendes, des
Batailles,” a collection of verse published by “L'Abbaye” in 1907;
“L'Homme en Tête,” in 1909; “Selon ma Loi,” in 1910; and “Compagnons,”
in 1912, gave him a definite place in the literary hierarchy. These
plays were “La Lumière,” which appeared in 1911; “Dans l'Ombre des
Statues,” in 1912; “Le Combat,” a symbolic drama in _vers libres_, in
1912; and “L'Œuvre des Athlètes” in 1920. All of these were produced on
the Paris stage and all save the last have appeared in translations by
Sasha Best in _Poet Lore_, Boston, in 1914 and 1915.

These dramas, as well as his early poetry, show the influence of Walt
Whitman. His message is conveyed through the medium of symbolism, his
method being to create types rather than individual studies, and his
purpose to bring art closer to the masses. The result, as might have
been expected, is drama of no great popularity.

Almost simultaneously with his work as poet and dramatist M. Duhamel
achieved prominence as a critic. For some years he was critic of
poetry for _Le Mercure de France_, and his articles contributed to
that publication were collected in book form in 1914 under the title
of “Les Poètes et la Poésie.” His earliest critical work, however, was
a collaboration with M. Charles Vildrac, called “Mots sur la Technique
Poétique.” “Propos Critique,” published in 1912, is largely devoted to
comments on the efforts of the younger and, at that time, comparatively
unknown writers, and it is of special interest that many of these
writers are now famous.

“Paul Claudel: le philosophe--le poète--l'ecrivain--le dramaturge,”
published in 1913, is considered by some of Duhamel's admirers as the
best of his critical works, marked as it is by the same gifts of
analysis and charm of style which distinguished his briefer critical
writings.

It is, however, chiefly of his work since the beginning of the war, and
the direction which his ideas and aims have taken under the influence
of the war, that this article is concerned.

When the war broke out it found Georges Duhamel--then about thirty
years of age--intent upon his literary work: poetry, criticism,
interpretation, which had put him in the first rank of littérateurs of
his country. Mobilised in the Medical Corps he first went to Verdun and
found himself in the thick of the carnage; but he was soon transferred
to the Marne where in the comparative quiet of a hospital he was able
to make the observations and write the reflections which have carried
his name throughout the civilised world. During the four years of the
war he produced four remarkable volumes: “Vie des Martyrs” (The New
Book of Martyrs), “Civilisation,” “Possession du Monde” (The Heart's
Domain), and “Entretiens dans le Tumulte” (Interviews in the Tumult),
four of the most noteworthy and important books inspired by the war.

Plunged at once into the great war hopper whose purpose was to reduce
all human material to a homogeneous mass that would furnish energy for
the war machine, Duhamel preserved his perspective and his individual
outlook both upon the war and upon life. Nothing illustrates this so
strikingly as some of his stories in “Civilisation,” gathered from
scenes with which he came into contact after he had become a seasoned
soldier.

No stronger proof is needed of the essential wholesomeness and strength
of Duhamel's make-up than the fact that while these stories, and those
of “Vie des Martyrs,” were inspired by the horrors of the war, they do
not depict horrors, nor do they create an atmosphere of horror. It is
not the picture of healthy men in the flower of youth, in the vigour
of virility fed to the war machine and left lacerated and broken,
that Duhamel impresses upon the imaginations of his readers. It was
thus that he had seen them in the first days of the siege of Verdun,
in an improvised ambulance where from minute to minute new torments
developed to increase their previous torments, while the fragile roof
over their heads became a great resounding board for the projectiles
of the siegers and the assieged. He had, however, the vision to see
them in another light, and he was filled with pity and admiration for
the French poilu. It is these two emotions, rather than horror, which
make the atmosphere and colour of the two books of war stories. He
sensed the significance of pain and saw the reactions of strong men to
suffering. He saw man in his agony give the lie to the most misleading
of all statements: that man is born equal. For neither in living nor in
dying is there equality. Men are equal, we trust, before God, and they
are alleged to be equal before the law, but after that equality of man
does not exist.

It is this book particularly that makes Duhamel the interpreter of
the poor, the obscure, the stupid, the inarticulate. With an unerring
intuition he reaches the soul. His sympathies are so large, his
understanding so comprehensive, and his reflection of them so complete,
that his readers suffer with the suffering. It seems impossible to
depict the sufferings of these poor martyrs, sent like droves of cattle
to be struck down for what purpose they knew not, more accurately and
convincingly than he does. With the reader's sympathy thus awakened,
one wonders that the individual can be deprived of his own right to
judge whether the cause is great enough for him to lay down his all; to
be crushed by the chariots of the god of war.

M. Duhamel, in “Vie des Martyrs,” has succeeded in making his martyrs
immortal. To him has been given in a superlative degree that seeing
eye, that understanding heart, that power of vision which, perhaps more
than any other gift, enriches life, since it enables the fortunate
possessor to rid himself of the trammels of his own narrow existence
and live the lives of many.

He has made a contribution to behaviouristic psychology in these little
stories, or better said sketches from life, that will endure. He has
been able to convey to unenlightened man the difference between the
_bon_ and the _mauvais blessé_ and to show that it is soul difference
as well as bodily difference. He has portrayed in simple colours the
desire to live, and the determination to live, factors which physicians
know are most important in forecasting the chances of recovery of every
sick man. And with it all there is tenderness, which the author has had
the power to convey through delicacy of style that makes prose poetry
of much of his narrative of the thoughts, aspirations, sentiments, and
plans of individual men who, from their appearance and position, are
the most commonplace of the commonplace. There is no anger, violence,
hatred, or despair in any of his pictures. There is sometimes irony,
but it is of so gentle a nature that it strengthens the impression of
sympathy with his characters, rather than suggesting judgment of them.

“A human being suffers always in his flesh alone, and that is why
war is possible,” says M. Duhamel in “Civilisation.” This is one of
those marvellous epitomes of human conduct, of which he has framed
many. It is vouchsafed to but few to understand and suffer another's
pain. To the majority of mankind it is denied. Were it not so, the
fellow-feeling that makes us wondrous kind would displace greed.

There are so many remarkable features of M. Duhamel's war books, such,
for instance, as what may be called the thesis of “Vie des Martyrs”:
that men suffer after their own image and in their own loneliness; or
of “Civilisation”: that consciousness has outrun life; that it has
created for itself reactions and inhibitions so intricate and profound
that they cannot be tolerated by life, that I was keen to learn how
these attitudes had developed. When questioned, this is what he said:

    “I am forced to divide things in the way practiced in the
    sciences; that is to say, not to confuse the study of facts with
    conclusions drawn from them. In these two books I showed as
    faithfully as I could the life and sufferings of soldiers during
    the war. In the latter two (“The Heart's Domain” and “Interviews
    in the Tumult”) I drew conclusions from the facts established
    in the first two. This procedure seemed to me the best way to
    handle anti-war propaganda. The weakness of most books results
    from the fact that the idea or subject is confused with other,
    regrettably often sentimental, considerations. The procedure
    employed in the sciences seems to be more orderly, and therefore
    more convincing for the exposition of my ideas. These books
    awoke a great echo, because they corresponded closely to the
    state of mind of sensible men who are bent on doing everything
    to make war impossible. Because of this I was looked upon as
    a Pacifist, and I regard this as an honour. I have never been
    politically active nor do I belong to any political group.
    However I am a Pacifist and an Internationalist. I believe that
    it is only the individual that can be an Internationalist.
    A nation will never be Internationalist for the reason that
    Pacifism and Internationalism are indissolubly bound up with
    individualism.”

M. Duhamel's work cannot, therefore, be considered solely in the light
of its literary qualities. By his own admission he is a writer with a
purpose, and this purpose is the suppression of war. In the interview
he stated that this purpose fills all of his work and “will be, I
believe, the axis of my work all my life.”

Regarding the four war books in this light, a sincere critic can hardly
escape the conviction that the author has accomplished the first part
of his task with immeasurably greater success than the latter part. Of
the convincing appeal of the two books which aim only to present vivid
and truthful pictures of the sufferings of the soldiers during the war
there can be no question. But of the author's power as a propagandist
against war, as expressed in the two latter books, it is by no means
easy to form so satisfactory an estimate.

Duhamel does not believe that the war developed a _modus vivendi_ for
the world. He thinks it left us where it found us, only exhausted.
Unless something is devised while this exhaustion is being overcome,
the conflict will be taken up again. He believes that a revolution is
necessary, but not a revolution in the sense of the term that applies
to the affairs of Russia or Ireland.

When Duhamel is read in the light of history, especially of the last
one hundred and twenty-five years, one is less hopeful than if he were
ignorant of history. If any _ex cathedra_ statement is justifiable
it would seem to be this: the world war flowed more or less directly
from the revolutionary movement which began with the dissemination of
the doctrine of the French philosophers, especially Rousseau, toward
the end of the Eighteenth Century. His discourse “On the Origin of
Inequality Amongst Men” is the fountainhead of modern socialism and the
source from which the ferment that brought about the world revolution
emanated. Rousseau's thesis was that civilisation had proven itself to
be the curse of humanity and that man in his primitive state was free
and happy.

    “The first time he knew unhappiness was when convention stepped
    in and said 'you must not do this and you must not do that,' and
    the State stepped in and said 'this is private property.' The
    first man who bethought himself of saying 'this is mine,' and
    found people simple enough to believe him was the real founder
    of civil society. What crimes, what wars, what murders, what
    miseries and horrors would he have spared the human race who,
    snatching away the spade and filling in the ditches, had cried
    out to his fellows: 'beware of listening to this impostor; you
    are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to
    all and the earth to no one.'”

It was the dissemination of this doctrine and the writings of Voltaire
which led to the “Feast of Reason,” and the publication of the
“Encyclopédie” that led to the world volcanic eruption of 1789, which
had its repetition in 1914.

It seems that most of these ideas were to be found in the writings of
Adam Weishaupt, an apostate Catholic, who founded the secret society
known as the “Illiminati” in 1776. It is interesting to compare some of
his statements with Duhamel's aspirations.

    “When men united themselves into nations, national love took the
    place of universal love. With the division of the globe into
    countries benevolence restricted itself behind boundaries that
    it was never again to transgress. It became a virtue to spread
    out at the expense of those who did not happen to be under our
    dominion. In order to attain this goal it became permissible to
    despise foreigners and to deceive and offend them. This virtue
    was called patriotism. Patriotism gave birth to localism, to
    the family spirit, and finally to egoism. Thus the origin of
    states or governments of civil society was the seed of discord
    and patriotism found its punishment in itself. Do away with this
    love of country, and men will once more learn to know and love
    each other as men; there will be no more partiality; the ties
    between hearts will unroll and extend.”

Duhamel wants to develop this relationship between men, but he wants to
do it in a very different way.

This moral revolution will be accomplished when men love one another,
and when they reward good for evil. Even though this had not been
shouted from the housetops and whispered through the lattice, in
every tongue and in every clime for the past twenty centuries, we
should still feel that M. Duhamel is in error, for these precepts are
at variance with the teachings of biology, the science for which M.
Duhamel has so much respect. You might just as well ask a man who is
drowning not to struggle as to ask a man to return good for evil--that
is unless he is doing it as a stunt, an artefact, or in redemption of
the promise to be saved. It is against nature. First teach him to put a
new valuation on life and to get new standards of what makes life worth
living. Then M. Duhamel will have a foundation to build upon.

That M. Duhamel is no less earnest than sincere in his purpose is
proved by his lectures through Europe during the last few years, as
protagonist for the suppression of war; and also by the fact that
he was one of the co-founders of “Clarté,” so named for the book by
Barbusse, which is a group of men who preach anti-militarism, the
intellectual solidarity of nations, and the social equality of all
citizens.

“Possession du Monde” is by virtue of its title a frank avowal of
its aim to set forth the author's idea of finding some satisfactory
substitute for the world possession for which the war was fought. It is
the effort of a wholesome, buoyant, sympathetic man, after having been
brought into contact with the horrors of the war, to find a substitute
for orthodox religion; the expression of an emotionally religious man
without a creed. M. Duhamel, who was brought up a Catholic, lost all
religion, he said, when he was fifteen years old.

The panacea which Duhamel offers in this book for human suffering
and world ills is the conscious striving for happiness by means of a
sort of “culture of the soul.” He puts a personal construction upon
happiness and holds that it is and should be the object of all humanity
and of the whole world of living things. He quotes Maeterlinck to the
effect that “As man is created for health, so was man created for
happiness.” This soul culture is rather an attitude of feeling toward
things than an attitude of thought. There is no attempt to think out
any of the problems which have puzzled men for ages. Neither is there
any denying of them. He simply says substantially: I am a practical
man. Of course I take things as they are--or as they seem to be--but I
take the best that is in them. I take the sunshine, the flowers, the
wisdom of the ages, the art that has come down to us, the science,
human love, the fine qualities of friendship, work, play, my sorrows
and adversities, even religion--but I take only what is good out
of them all; and I take that temperately, sanely, according to the
limitations which nature and circumstances have imposed. And I am
happy. You can do likewise and you can be happy.

But can I take poverty and want, and particularly can I take them with
equanimity while my neighbour or brother is swaggering with riches,
some of which he has robbed me because he is stronger or cleverer than
I? Duhamel's formula for achieving happiness, as well as his conception
of what constitutes happiness, only fits the average man, and it has
been proven countless thousands of times that there is no such person.
It is sufficient, perhaps, for people who feel normally and do not
think for themselves. So it may be sufficient for the present for a
mass of people who want to be led--if they are pious and healthy.

But how about the people who are different, or who are not healthy,
or who think they are safer custodians of wealth and power than their
so-called brothers? It brings no help to the people who are tortured
by an insistent need to think things out for themselves, or else to
find something which will answer their questions as to the why. Nor
does it tell those who are handicapped, physically, mentally, or even
temperamentally, how they can overcome their handicaps so as to, as it
were, extract the honey from the flowers. The world is full of people
with all degrees of unusualness and abnormality. One may ignore them,
but no scheme of things can deny them. Duhamel uses them by preference
as a basis for his fiction.

In his conception of happiness Duhamel reads himself and his own
emotions into all things. He avers that the algæ growing in a tank of
water with nothing but a few grains of dust and sunlight are happy
because they subsist and work out their humble joy. Has any sentient
soul told him he was happy under parallel circumstances? That is the
question. He reads his own philosophy into the algæ. To him to be
living as nature intended one to live is to be happy. But who can say?
Just here I am reminded of a quotation from Anatole France of which
Duhamel makes use in this book: “Men have cut each others' throats
over the meaning of a word.” People might argue forever over the
meaning of the word “happiness” and never get anywhere.

Duhamel says that happiness is the ultimate end of life and that
religion is the search for happiness in a life to come after this.
Everybody wants to be happy in this life and some people expect to
be happy in a life after this--of these two assertions there can be
no doubt. But Duhamel says there is no life after this, and that the
sole object of life is to be happy in this world. He does, however,
speak of “saving the soul,” and he implies his belief in God. He says
substantially that the plants are happy because they are fulfilling
their destiny, or doing what God meant them to do; and implies that man
will be happy if he does the same. Very likely. But shall he strive to
fulfill his destiny--to do what God meant him to do--merely in order
to be happy? Or shall he strive to fulfill his destiny--and happiness
will follow incidentally? Which should be his conscious end, happiness
or the fulfilment of his destiny? Most religious people would say the
latter. Duhamel says the former. But, for working purposes they are
about the same, except that, for people who are at all temperamental
or who meet with many discouragements, it is frequently difficult to
strive for a happiness which seems elusive. Whereas, such people, if
they are spiritually minded, can always find a stimulus in trying to do
what they were intended to do. And if they believe in God the stimulus
becomes greater. And if they can believe that the soul grows through
every honest effort--that nothing is ever lost, whether the result
appears to be success or failure--and that the limits of its growth
are not bounded by what their senses can tell them in this life, their
capacity for striving becomes sometimes amazing. How else account for
the man who expends ten times the effort in playing a losing game that
he would have spent in one that promised an easy success?

That the soul will find its greatest happiness in the contemplation
of itself, is Duhamel's belief. “He is the happiest man who best
understands his happiness; for he is of all men most fully aware that
it is only the lofty idea, the untiring courageous human idea, that
separates gladness from sorrow,” he quotes from Maeterlinck. A man
should think about his soul at least once every day. But it would
be safe to say that for one man who finds happiness in a life of
contemplation ten find it in a life of action. The wholesome, sane,
average, happy men--of whom Duhamel is an excellent example--are mostly
men of action. The very existence of this book is a contradiction of
his happiness of contemplation theory as applied to himself. It may
well be questioned whether Duhamel would have written “Possession du
Monde” if he had not been the kind of man who finds happiness in giving
expression to every emotion. Besides self-study is safe only for strong
natures. Self-analysis was the undoing of the man in one of Duhamel's
best books, “Confession de Minuit.”

Finally, what is “happiness”? Is it merely a feeling? Gladness? If
that were all, and the ultimate end of life, would not the logical
conclusion be that the happiest--and therefore the most successful--man
would be the joyful maniac?

The publication of M. Duhamel which has the greatest popularity is the
one that his admirers would wish he had not written: “Possession du
Monde.” It is a protest against the evaluation of life commercially,
and a plea for a moral or spiritual standard. This is a topic for an
epoch maker, and one who has not a vision or a plan should not essay
it. M. Duhamel may have both, but he does not reveal them. He displays
only the wish that the world should be better. In the jargon of the
Freudian, it is a wish-fulfilment that does not realise. It is neither
well done nor convincing, and it has been well and convincingly done
by many writers, and still we have not profited by it. Amiel did it;
Maeterlinck did it; Karr did it; and “others too numerous to mention.”
They may have had some effect upon individuals, but the history of
the past eight years shows that they had no effect upon the world
at large, its evolution, or devolution. Moreover, there is a note
of unction and self-satisfaction running through the book that is
displeasing, if not offensive. It is quite true, or likely to be true,
that “to think about the soul, to think about it at least once in the
confusion of every crowded day, is indeed the beginning of salvation,”
but there is a book in which this is said in a more convincing way than
M. Duhamel can ever hope to say it.

Viewed from a literary standpoint alone, the book is in keeping with,
if not quite up to, the standard of his other works. His prose is
always musical, and he often creates an atmosphere rather than an
edifice. He is never emphatic, mandatory, severe, superlative. He is
soft, gentle, often ironical, but always human.

Two remarkable pieces of fiction constitute Duhamel's output since the
four war books: “Les Hommes Abandonnés” (Abandoned Men) and “Confession
de Minuit” (Midnight Confession). The first contains eight histories
which try to prove that when men are gathered together in a crowd they
are abandoned by the individual soul. It is an illustration on the
reverse side in favour of individualism.

“Confession de Minuit” is particularly significant as being named
by the author in the interview as his favourite work. “As a human
research I believe that it is the one with the most meaning,” he said
of this novel; and it is, therefore, a matter of self-congratulation
on the part of the writer that he found this book to be the one
which interpreted to him the author's particular genius in the most
convincing and interesting light The story has its bearing upon the
author's theories because it illustrates more clearly than any of his
other works a statement made by him in the interview:

    “People often reproach me with being interested only in my
    stories with sick people or with children. Healthy men do
    not register the motives which govern them. When one studies
    a sick person one is able to see the relations between moral
    characteristics which in the healthy man exist, but are hidden.”
    However, I hold that the average man, healthy, typical, scarcely
    exists in literature, and that the most interesting creations
    from the human point of view had for their subjects men who were
    unbalanced--from Hamlet to Leopold Bloom; from Raskolnikov to
    Dorian Gray.

“Confession de Minuit” is the self-revelation of a man who was
decidedly unbalanced. As a bit of art work the book is unique and
remarkable. Almost the unity of a short-story is preserved without
recourse to any of the usual machinery of the ordinary novel, such as
plot, action, or conversation, except a very little of the most casual
nature. To a person who reads fiction for character delineation this
absence of trappings is a distinct gain.

“Confession de Minuit” is the story of a man than whom a more
uninteresting person could hardly be found in life; and yet as told by
the man himself, Duhamel sustains the interest of the reader in the
recital of pitiful weakness from the first page to the last without one
lapse into dryness or loss of sympathy for the character, with whom, in
the flesh, it would have been hard to feel any sentiment besides pity.
It opens with the incident which causes the man to lose his position
as a small clerk in an office through an utterly senseless--although
perfectly harmless--performance: yielding to a sudden impulse to touch
the ear of his employer just to assure himself that the employer
was really made of flesh and blood, as himself. As society, or in
this case the employer, is more afraid of an insane person than of a
criminal, the reader does not share the man's feeling of injustice
because he is first confronted with a revolver and then thrown speedily
and bodily out of the office where he had been a faithful worker for
several years; although he is able to pity the victim. The story,
as told by the man himself, traces his rapid deterioration through
progressive stages of self-pity, self-absorption, and inability to get
hold of himself, to make an effort to re-establish himself, or even
to seek advice or sympathy, until the last night when he pours out
his “confession” to a stranger, with the statement that, on account
of his failure in every relation in life, he is never going home to
his old mother who has supported him with her small income and her
needlework--nor is he ever going anywhere else, so far as the reader
can see. He does not commit suicide. In fact, the story leaves one with
the impression that he is merely “going crazy.” Whether or not he is
insane when the recital begins with the commission of the insane act is
a matter for neither the novelist nor the critic to state.

The great art of the writer lies in his ability to sustain interest at
a high level in a pure character study of what is frequently described
as a “shut-in personality.”

This novel seems to have been written without reference to the author's
happiness or “cult of the soul” theory. It might almost be construed
as a contradiction of it. One might put a fatalistic construction upon
it, if one did not take a material point of view of health and disease.
I do not see how anyone could get away from the conviction that the
man who makes the “Midnight Confession” of his own pitiful failure
in life is a victim of either his own mental limitations, or else of
his particular environment, or of both. The only other way in which
anyone might account for his utter inability to get hold of life or to
stand up against his first discouragement is the refuge of the Radical
Socialist--that society gave him no chance, the concrete illustration
being the cruel way in which constituted authority, or his employer,
treated his first downward step. But if the author had intended to
condemn the employer and to excuse the man he would hardly have
selected for this step an act which would so readily arouse a question
as to the man's sanity, nor would he have followed the incident with
a story in which the only development was rapidly increasing loss of
touch with the outside world. No philosophy, or religion, or cult could
have helped this man, who was handicapped with a nature so weak that it
could not resist an impulse which would have been suppressed instantly
by any well-balanced person; nor could it have given him the strength
to withstand the simple discouragements that are the inevitable lot of
all men. He simply was not able to cope with something--define it as
one may.

One moral the story teaches. And that is the nobility of sympathy with
even the weakest, most despised, and least interesting of human beings.

M. Duhamel consecrates his life to the prevention of war. It is a noble
gesture. He is gifted, sane, articulate, and temperamentally adapted
and adjusted to the task. Were he a platonist and not a neo-platonist,
I am sure greater success would crown his efforts. Twenty-five hundred
years ago a man who penetrated the mysteries of life and death more
deeply than anyone before or since said to his pupils who had gathered
to speed him to the Great Beyond, the ship having returned from Delos
and the Eleven having decided to release Socrates from his fetters:

    “The body fills us with passions and desires, and fears, and all
    manner of phantoms and much foolishness; and so, as the saying
    goes, in very truth we can never think at all for it. It alone
    and its desires, cause war and factions and battles for the
    origin of all wars is the pursuit of wealth.”

Until that pursuit can be substituted, the labours of M. Duhamel and
his co-founders of “Clarté” are likely to be in vain.




                              CHAPTER XI
    EVEN YET IT CAN'T BE TOLD--THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT D. H. LAWRENCE


About twenty years ago a brilliant, unbalanced, young Austrian Jew
wrote a book, “Sex and Character,” whose purpose was to show that woman
had played a greater rôle in the world than her possessions warranted,
that she was inherently devoid of morality, and that men should cease
to procreate. In the autumn of 1903 its author, Otto Weininger, then
twenty-three years old, shot and killed himself in the house in Vienna
in which Beethoven had died. The author's awful theme and his tragic
end caused the book to be widely read and even more widely discussed.
Amongst those impressed by it was a boy of humble but uncommon
parents, bred in the coal-fields of mid-England where he had led a
strenuous life struggling with the sex question, contending with the
stream of consciousness as it became swollen with the tributaries of
puberty--“Oh, stream of hell which undermined my adolescence.” While
still a youth he felt the influence of another Austrian mystic of the
same faith, Sigmund Freud, who maintains that the unconscious is the
real man, that its energiser and director is the libido, and that
the conscious is the artificed, the engendered man whose tenant and
executive is the ego. By day and by night this exceptionally gifted and
burdened boy took his grist to these two mystic millers. To comfort
himself, to keep up his courage in the dark on his journeys to the mill
and from it, he read the Bible, the poetry of Walt Whitman and Robert
Browning, and the prose of Thomas Hardy. From the Old Testament he got
an unsurpassed capacity for narrative and metaphor, while the “grey
poet” whetted his appetite for worship and exaltation of the human
body. Well might he say of Whitman, as Dante said of Virgil:

  “Tu sè'lo mio maestro e il mio autore
  Tu sè'solo colui, da cui io tòlsi
  Lo bèllo stile che m'à fatto onore.”

Thus D. H. Lawrence, like Jeshurun, waxed fat and kicked, forsook
God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his Salvation.
And he began to pour forth his protest in a series of books, each a
little more lawless than its predecessor, culminating in “The Rainbow.”
The book was suppressed by the Government of his own country, but
the censors of our “free country,” who pronounced “Jurgen” a book
prejudicial to public morals, allowed “The Rainbow” to be published
here. Perhaps that is the reason “Jurgen” has been published in England
without molest. After that, when Mr. Lawrence wished to circulate his
contributions to world-purification and progress, which many call
pornography, he resorted to the camouflage of “published privately for
subscribers only.”

My information is that Mr. Lawrence is not so widely read in the United
States as are many of his contemporaries, Mr. Compton Mackenzie or
Mr. Frank Swinnerton, for example. But there is a Lawrence cult here
and it is growing, particularly amongst those who like to be called
Greenwich Villagers, the breath of whose nostrils is antinomianism,
especially sex antinomianism. Moreover, he has a way of interpolating
between his salacious romances and erotic poetry books of imagination,
observation, and experience, such as “Bay” and “Twilight in Italy,”
that are couched in language whose swing and go few can withstand.
These are replete with descriptions of sense-stirring scenery and
analyses of sex-tortured souls, analyses which give lyric expression
to the passions of the average man, who finds their lurid and ecstatic
depiction diverting. Finally, Mr. Lawrence is striving to say
something--something of sex and self which he believes the world should
know; indeed, which is of paramount importance to it--and his manner
of saying it has been so seductive that there are probably many who,
like myself, have been clinging to him, as it were, buying his books
and reading him with the hope that eventually he would succeed.

The time limit given him by one of his admirers and well-wishers has
expired. In taking leave of him I purpose to set down my reasons for
severing the emotional and intellectual thread that has kept us--even
though so very loosely, and to him, quite unawaredly--together.

This renders unavoidable a line or two about criticism. I accept
Matthew Arnold's estimate of the function of criticism, “to make known
the best that is thought and known in the world,” providing that the
critic also exposes the poor and meretricious which is being palmed
off as “just as good,” or which is bidding for estimate, high or low.
A guide should not only show the traveller upon whose eyes the scales
still rest, or who has set out on a journey before the dawn, the
right road, but he should also warn him of perilous roads and specify
whether the peril is from bandits, broken bridges, or bellowing bulls.
It is needless to say that the guide should have travelled the road
and should know it and its environment well, and that his information
should be recent.

The road that Mr. D. H. Lawrence has been travelling for the past
decade and more, and making the basis for descriptions of his trips, is
well known to me. I have worked upon it, laughed upon it, cried upon it
for more than a quarter of a century. My information of it is recent,
for there, even now, I earn my daily bread. It is the road leading from
Original Sin to the street called Straight. All must travel it. Some
make the journey quickly; some laboriously. Some, those who have morbid
sex-consciousness in one form or another, inadequate or deviate genetic
endowment, are unable to finish the journey at all.

[Illustration: D. H. LAWRENCE]

Mr. Lawrence seems to have learned early that he could not fulfill
his own nature passionately, and he has been struggling all his life to
find the way in which fulfilment lies. It is generally believed that
“Sons and Lovers” is largely autobiographical and that the writer is to
be identified with Paul. In that book he gave ample testimony that he
could not fulfill himself because of the conflict between mother-love
and uxorial love; for we may venture to catalogue Paul's consortional
experiences under that heading, even though he had no marriage lines.
He has never been able to define just how he expected to fulfill his
nature, but one may legitimately conclude from some of his recent
publications that he believes, if the strings of the lyre of sensuality
can be made taut enough and twanged savagely enough, the tone produced
will constitute not only fulfilment and happiness, but an eternity of
ecstasy, a timeless extension of that indescribable exaltation that
Dostoievsky was wont to experience in moments preceding his epileptic
seizures, which is so vividly described by him and which made such
an impression upon his thoughts and so influenced his imagery. Mr.
Lawrence apparently believes that fulfilment will be meditated by one
“who will touch him at last on the root and quicken his darkness and
perish on him as he has perished on her.” When this happens,

  “We shall be free, freer than angels, ah, perfect”;

and,

    “After that, there will only remain that all men detach
    themselves and become unique Conditioned only by our pure single
    being, having no laws but the laws of our own being.”

Finally:

  “Every human being will then be like a flower, untrammelled.”

    “Ideas and ideals are the machine plan and the machine
    principles of an automatonised Psyche which has been so
    prejudicial to human progress and human welfare. We must get
    rid of them both.”

In fact, it is a world without ideals for which Mr. Lawrence is
clamouring and which he maintains he is in process of creating. It must
be allowed that he is working industriously to do it, but most people,
I fancy, will continue to believe that his world will not be a fit
place to live in should he be able to finish his task. Meanwhile he
is doing much to make the world less livable than it might otherwise
be, particularly for those who are not competent to judge whether any
of Mr. Lawrence's contentions are tenable or any of his statements in
harmony with the evidence of science.

“Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious” contains more misinformation in
a small space than almost any recent book save the “Cruise of the
Kawa.” It may reasonably be expected that anyone who writes upon
psychoanalysis and the unconscious today and expects a hearing should
know something about biology. But no biologist would accept such
dogmatic statements as

    “Life begins now, as always, in an individual living creature.
    In the beginning of the individual living creature is the
    beginning of life, every time and always. And life has no
    beginning apart from this.... There is no assignable and no
    logical reason for individuality.”

To give such sentences the semblance of truth there should have
been added, “so far as I know.” It is misleading to follow up such
statements by saying, “having established so much,” etc. A poet may be
permitted to say that “The young bull in the field has a wrinkled and
sad face.” Indeed, he may abandon all morphology and animal behaviour
and make the graceful serpent rest its head upon its shoulder! But the
man who invades the field of science should, at least, practise some
accuracy of expression, even though he give himself the latitude of
poetic license.

“The White Peacock” was Mr. Lawrence's first novel. It was favourably
received. Letty, the principal character, is the trial portrait of all
his later heroines. Her creator, in his youth and inexperience, did
not know how to make her “carry on,” but she is the _anlage_ for all
his female characters, their immoralities and bestialities. Her story
is a simple one. Her mother, a lady of fine character, has been put to
the acid test by the moral defalcation of her father, a drunkard and
wastrel with charm. Leslie, a young man with money and social position,
commonplace, emotionally shallow, spiritually inelastic, unimaginative,
but intelligent and straightforward, wooes the temperamental, volatile,
romantic Letty. The appeal which Leslie did not make to her is made by
George, a young farmer “stoutly built, brown-eyed and fair-skinned,”
whom Letty finds “ruddy, dark and with greatly thrilling eyes” and
whom she calls her bull. Meanwhile George and Letty's brother form
a friendship which is in dimmest outline the prototype of that
extraordinary relationship existing between Gerald Crich and Rupert
Birkin in “Women in Love.”

The book shows the influence of Thomas Hardy, after whom Lawrence
in his early youth sedulously patterned himself. In those days he
was concerned with the photographic description of rustic scenes and
particularly the lives of farmers and miners--which he knew from
experience--and showed a sensitive appreciation of natural beauty.
But the interest of the book is in the fact that it contains trial
pictures of most of his later characters. George is Tom Brangwen of
“The Rainbow”; Leslie, grown up and more arrogant, is Gerald in “Women
in Love” and Gerald Barlow in “Touch and Go”; Cyril, more experienced
and daring, is called Rupert Birkin when he is introduced again. In
all of Lawrence's books the same characters appear. They vary only
in having different standards and different degrees of immorality.
The environment is always the same--a mining town; a countryside
pitted with collieries; farms teeming with evidence of vegetable and
animal life which is described with such intensity that the reader
feels he is witnessing a new era of creation; mean drab houses; and
squalid pubs. Into these and the schoolhouses and churches he puts his
sex-tortured men and hyper-sexed women and surges them with chaotic
vehemence of invitation and embrace and with the aches, groans, and
shrieks of amorous love.

His second novel, “The Trespassers,” shows the author to have, in
addition to a sensitive and impassioned apprehension of nature, great
capacity for describing the feelings of commonplace people. Helena,
headstrong, determined, emancipated, self-sufficient, falls in love
with her music teacher, Sigmund, a man of forty who had married when
seventeen a matter-of-fact young woman who gave him many children which
he ill-supported while she slaved and became sour and slatternly.
Helena notices that Sigmund is tired and suggests that they spend a few
days together in the Isle of Wight. She makes the plans, finds a nice
motherly person who will take them into her cottage more for company
than money, and, though this seems to be her first adventure, she acts
with the certainty which attends experience. The scenery and tools
that Mr. Lawrence uses so skilfully are all here: moonlight and its
effect to produce ecstasy; bathing and lying naked on the sand or the
grass and gazing approvingly at the body; lovely flowers and plants;
and above all, a knowledge of the effects of baffled eroticism, of
collision between primitive simple passion and artificial fantasying
aberrant passion. Like Hermione Roddice of “Women in Love,” Helena's
genetic instincts are abnormal. She has her Louisa, ten years her
senior, whom she treats with indifference, cruelty, or affection, as it
pleases her. Early in the history of man the prototype of Helena and
Hermione was known. Shuah's second son, it is alleged, was the first
example. The Lord slew Onan as soon as he deliberately violated the
first and most essential principle of nature, but this drastic measure
did not eradicate the biologic aberration, for it has displayed itself
in the human species from that day to this, and even today gives more
concern to parents and pedagogues than any other instinct deviation.
Fortunately novelists, until the advent of Mr. Lawrence, have not
featured this infirmity.

Even in these juvenile days, Mr. Lawrence left very little to the
imagination. Helena and Sigmund, lying on the cold wet beach in the
twilight, enveloped in the Scotch mist (parenthetically it may be
said that his heroes and heroines are wholly insensitive to bodily
discomfort when they are in the throes of concupiscence) were
practising the “Overture to Love,”

    “and when Helena drew her lips away she was much exhausted.
    She belonged to that class of dreaming women with whom passion
    exhausts itself at the mouth. Her desire was accomplished in a
    real kiss. She then wanted to go to sleep. She sank away from
    his caresses, passively, subtly drew back from him.”

The next morning Sigmund goes into the sea, and this gives the author
opportunity to display the burning passion which the sight and
contemplation of the male human body seems to cause in him.

    “He glanced at his wholesome maturity, the firm plaiting of
    his breasts, the full thighs, creatures proud in themselves,
    and said 'She ought to be rejoiced at me, but she is not. She
    rejects me as if I were a baboon under my clothing.'”

When Mr. Lawrence convinced himself that he could write a more
panoplied description of erotic ecstasy than that with which he
afflicted Helena, he wrote the description of Ursula's encounter with
the moon in “The Rainbow.” Indeed the real motive of “The Trespassers”
is a trial portrait of Ursula; and while making up his mind as to
the size of the canvas and the colours that he would use in painting
that modern Messalina, Mr. Lawrence gave the world “Sons and Lovers,”
which more than any other of his books, gave him a reputation for an
understanding of the strange blood bonds that unite families and human
beings, and for having an unusual, almost exquisite discrimination in
the use of language.

From boyhood Mr. Lawrence seems to have been possessed of a demon who
whispered to him by day and shrieked to him by night, “Be articulate,
say it with words,” and the agony of his impotence is heartrending,
as frustration after frustration attends his efforts. He tries it
in prose, then in verse. Gradually, from taking thought, from sex
experience and from hasty perusal of scientific and mystic literature,
there formulated in his mind a concrete thought, which in time
engendered a conviction, finally an obsession. A brief exposition of
the mental elaboration and the Laocoon grip that it took on him follows:

The Greeks, fanning the embers of Egyptian civilisation and getting no
fire for their torch, said,

    “Let there be an ideal to which all mankind shall bow the knee.
    Let consciousness and all its manifestations be expressed in
    terms of ideals and ideas or in conduct that expresses them, and
    finally let everything that tends to hinder such expression,
    such as the sensual and animal in man be subdued and repressed.”

Christianity went a step further and said,

    “Not only shall ideals be exalted, but pure spirituality and
    perfection--man's goal--can only be obtained by the annihilation
    of what are called Animal Instincts.”

[Illustration: D. H. LAWRENCE] From a drawing by _Jan Juta._

Christianity's promoters and well-wishers realised, however, that
the continuance of the race depended upon the gratification of these
appetites, and so laws and conventions were made under whose operation
they could be legitimately indulged, there being small hope that the
wish expressed by Sir Thomas Browne, the author of “Religio Medici” and
a flock of children, that man might procreate as do the trees, should
ever be gratified. In civilised lands the conquest of the lower self
has been objective. Man has moved from a great impulse within himself,
the unconscious. Once the conquest has been effected, the conscious
mind turns, looks, and marvels:

  “E come quei che con lena affannata
  Uscito fuor del pelago alla riva,
  Si volge all'acqua perigliosa, e guata.”

This self-conscious mental provoking of sensation and reaction in the
great affective centres is called sentimentalism or sensationalism.
The mind returns upon the affective centres and sets up in them a
deliberate reaction. These are passions exploited by the mind. Or the
passional motive may act directly, and not from the mental provocation,
and these reactions may be reflected by a secondary process down into
the body. This is the final and most fatal effect of idealism, because
it reduces everything to self-consciousness into spuriousness, and it
is the madness of the world today. It is this madness that Mr. Lawrence
has sworn to cure. He is going to do it by conquering what he calls
the lower centres, by submitting the lowest plane to the highest.
When this is done there will be nothing more to conquer. Then all is
one, all is love, even hate is love, even flesh is spirit. The great
oneness, the experience of infirmity, the triumph of the living spirit,
which at last includes everything, is then accomplished. Man becomes
whole, his knowledge becomes complete, he is united with everything.
Mr. Lawrence has mapped out a plan of the sympathetic nervous system
and has manipulated what biologists call the tropisms in such a way as
to convince himself that he has laid the scientific foundation for his
work, but as there is scarcely a page or paragraph in his little book
that does not contain statements which are at variance with scientific
facts, it is unnecessary to say that his science will not assist him
in his propaganda nearly so much as his fiction. Like Weininger, he
finally eliminates women. As he puts it: “Acting from the last and
profoundest centres, man acts womanless.” It is no longer a question
of race continuance. It is a question of sheer ultimate being, the
perfection of life nearest to death and yet furthest away from it.
Acting from these centres man is an extreme being, the unthinkable
warrior, creator, mover, and maker. “And the polarity is between man
and man.”

That sentence contains to him who can read it aright the whole truth of
Mr. D. H. Lawrence. To some that brief statement has the luminousness
and significance of the writing on the wall. Anyone who reads Mr.
Lawrence's later books attentively--and I appreciate that it is some
task to do it--will understand it; and those who, like myself, have
devoted themselves to study of aberrations, genesic and mental, as they
display themselves in geniuses, psychopaths, and neuropaths, as well as
in ordinary men, will sense it correctly.

Mr. Lawrence thinks there are three stages in the life of man: the
stage of sexless relations between individuals, families, clans, and
nations; the stage of sex relations with an all-embracing passional
acceptance, culminating in the eternal orbit of marriage; and finally,
the love between comrades, the manly love which only can create a new
era of life. One state does not annul the other; it fulfills the other.
Such, in brief, is the strange venture in psychopathy Mr. Lawrence
is making, and contributions to it up to date are “Women in Love,”
“Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious,” and “Aaron's Rod.” “The Prussian
Officer,” “The Rainbow,” “The Lost Girl,” “Look, We Have Come Through”
were merely efforts to get his propaganda literature into shape.

The Adam and Eve of Mr. Lawrence's new creation are Tom Brangwen and
his wife; and to understand their descendants (and no one, not even
Mr. Lawrence, can understand them fully) one must study the parents.
Tom, the youngest of the Brangwen family, as a boy is rather heavy
and stupid intellectually, sensitive to the atmosphere around him,
brutal perhaps, but at the same time delicate, very delicate. He does
not get on in school, so he leaves precipitously when he is fifteen,
after having laid open the master's head with a slate, but not before
he has formed a masochistic friendship with a warm clever frail boy.
Sex desire begins soon to torment him. His first experience causes his
sensibilities to rebel, and the second is a failure because of his
self-consciousness and the dominancy of a budding inferiority complex.
He is on the way to anæsthetising desire by brandy drinking, to which
he periodically gives himself, when one day he meets on the street a
demure lady whose curious absorbed flitting motion arrests him and
causes a joy of pain to run through him.

    “She had felt Tom go by almost as if he had brushed her. She
    had tingled in body as she had gone up on the road. Her impulse
    was strong against him because he was not of her sort. But one
    blind instinct led her to take him, to have him, and then to
    relinquish herself to him. It would be safety. Also he was young
    and very fresh.”

Her passional reactions are not from the mind. They are spontaneous
and know no inhibition. After a second quite casual meeting, Tom
goes to the vicarage where she, a Polish lady, is housekeeper since
her husband, a doctor obliged to leave his country for political
reasons, had died and left her and her baby daughter in dire want.
“Good evening,” says Tom, “I'll just come in a minute”; and having
entered, he continues, “I came up to ask if you'd marry me.” He
arouses an intensity of passion in her that she cannot, or wishes
not, to withstand. But Tom is conventional and so they are married.
The description of his marital lust is lurid to the last degree, and
finally after one great debauch “he felt that God had passed through
the married pair and made Himself known to them.” Tom is largely brawn
and brute, though he has a vein of sentiment, and finally he yields
to drink and meets a violent death, leaving two sons, a namesake who
is attracted to his own sex, Fred who suffers the tortures of a
mother-sapped spirit, and Anna, his stepdaughter.

Anna hates people who come too near her until she meets Will Brangwen,
the son of Tom's brother who had flagrantly offended matrimonial
convention. She is fascinated by this æsthetic serious self-satisfied
youth with a high-pitched voice, who sings tenor and who is interested
in church architecture and ritualism. Anna hurls herself at Will's head
and tells him in no uncertain tones of her all-consuming love before
he makes any protests. She arranges the wheat shocks in the moonlight
so that they will propitiate her purpose, but only passionate caresses
and a proposal of marriage result. This disappoints her, but the men
of the Brangwen family, though consumed with elemental passion, are
sex-slackers compared with the women. Will goes into states of ecstasy
sitting motionless and timeless, contemplating stained-glass windows
and other religious symbols, and she hates him violently.

    “In the gloom and mystery of the church his soul lived and ran
    free, like some strange, underground thing, abstract. In this
    spirit he seemed to escape and run free of her.”

They are happy only when in the throes of conjugality. She is
profoundly fecund and has periods of ecstasy when she thinks God has
chosen her to prove the miracle of creation. In her exaltation, big
with child as she is, she dances naked in her bedroom, to the Creator
to Whom she belongs.

In order to develop the now widely disseminated Freudian ideas about
the love of the eldest girl for the father, the antagonism between the
mother and daughter, etc., Will falls in love with his oldest child,
Ursula. “His heart grew red-hot with passionate feeling for the child”
when she is about a year old. “Her father was the dawn wherein her
consciousness woke up wide-eyed, unseeing, she was awakened too soon.”
The writer, master as he is of the mysteries of perversion, uses this
sympathy and Will's extrauxorial vagaries and wanderings to cause,
vicariously, a welling-up of passion in Anna. After a revolting scene
with a grisette, Will goes home to his wife who immediately detects
that there is a change in him, that he has had a new experience. She
is excited to wild lubricity, and “he got an inkling of the vastness
of the unknown sensual store of delight she was.” But this is the book
of Ursula. The spontaneous passions of the grandmother and mother are
incidental.

Ursula goes through with the son of the old Polish clergyman Baron the
same sort of experience that her father went through with the flapper
that he picked up at the movie, only not with such _slancio_. The
purpose of this episode is to point out the intensity of love in the
female and her clamour for the dominant male. When Ursula finds that
Skrebensky is a slacker,

    “She stood filled with the full moon, offering herself. Her two
    breasts opened to make way for it, her body opened wide like a
    quivering anemone, a soft, dilated invitation touched by the
    moon. She wanted the moon to fill into her, she wanted more,
    more communion with the moon, consummation.”

Since Ursula has not met the one-hundred-per-cent male, and as “her
sexual life flamed into a kind of disease within her,” Mr. Lawrence now
brings her into relations with a finely portrayed Lesbian, Winifred
Inger. The description of their first real contact in the bungalow at
night and their night bath is willfully and purposely erotic. Ursula,
tired of Winifred, plans to marry her to her uncle, Tom. When they meet
“he detected in her a kinship with his own dark corruption. Immediately
he knew they were akin.” One might safely say that Mr. Lawrence had
before him, or in his mind's eye, when he penned the description of
Tom, the photograph of one of his fellow-poets of a generation ago whom
the English public found necessary to put in the Reading Gaol.

    “His manner was polite, almost foreign, and rather cold.
    He still laughed in his curious, animal fashion, suddenly
    wrinkling up his wide nose, and showing his sharp teeth. The
    fine beauty of his skin and his complexion, some almost waxen
    quality, hid the strange, repellant grossness of him, the slight
    sense of putrescence, the commonness which revealed itself in
    his rather fat thighs and loins.”

It is in the chapter “The Bitterness of Ecstasy” that Mr. Lawrence
takes off the brakes. In London, whither she has gone with Skrebensky,
Ursula decides to solve the riddle of the Sphinx. She goes about it in
the conventional Brangwen way by biting him, clawing him, and generally
tearing him to pieces. It seems good to him and he likes her and wants
to marry her. One day, after they have had some tall bouts of love at
Richmond, she tells him that she won't marry him and he has a grand
crisis of hysteria. She is sorry she has hurt him. She hails a cab and
takes the sobbing wooer home, and the lecherous cabby is moved nearly
to violence by the radiation of passion from Ursula. She senses danger
and persuades Tony to walk. She knows then that he is but a simulacrum
of man, and when she has gone home she decides that she will not marry.
Finally, however, she gives in and the date is more or less arranged.
Then comes the _grande finale_ with the scene wonderfully set in the
moonlight by the seashore. There she makes an onslaught on him that is
tigress-like to the last degree, throws him on the sand, devours him,
wrings him like a dirty rag, shows him that he is no good, and hurls
him from her, a sucked lemon. He sneaks away and offers himself to his
Colonel's daughter, is accepted, and is off to India, leaving “the need
of a world of men for her.”

Then comes “The Rainbow,” a parody of Freud's exposition of the dream
of being trampled upon by horses. Ursula finds after a time that the
customary result has followed her experiences, so she writes a letter
to Skrebensky saying she'll be good and go out and marry him. She goes
for a walk in the mist and the rain, into the wood where the trees
are all phallic symbols “thrust like stanchions upright between the
roaring overhead and the sweeping of the circle underfoot.” She begins
to hallucinate, to feel her subconsciousness take possession of her,
and the sight of a group of horses fills her bestial soul with a hope
that she might finally be possessed in such a way as would give her
satisfaction, that she might get “some fantastic fulfilment in her
life.” She goes into a state of delirium and several weeks later, when
it has passed, she finds that she has miscarried. This is followed by
a mild dementia; she thinks she is moral and will be good, but as she
gets strong she sees the rainbow, which is Eros kindling the flames
again.

    “And she saw in the rainbow the earth's new architecture, the
    old brittle corruption of houses and factories swept away, the
    world built up in a living fragment of Truth, fitting to the
    overarching heaven.”

Mr. Lawrence, exhausted with the perpetration of these sensual delights
and disappointed with the distrusts of the flesh, turned for a short
time to nature to refresh his spirit and bathe his soul. He sensed
frustration despite the unleashment of passion; he realised that
sublimation had eluded him, and so he turned to primitive life and
primitive people, the peasants of Italy. Soon his torments began to
creep up again in “Twilight in Italy.” The roused physical sensations
will not subside. They penetrate pastoral scenes and emanate from
sylvan scenery.

After having refreshed himself, he gave the world “The Lost Girl,”
whose genesic aberrations are comparatively mild, and whose antics
with the half-gipsy, half-circus folk are rather amusing. Some of Mr.
Lawrence's early admirers were encouraged to look for his reformation,
especially after the appearance of a thin book of poems entitled “Bay.”
Even in this, here and there, the inhibited and mother-sapped spirit
crops out, as in the poem called “The Little Town in the Evening,” but
for the most part the verses are founded on sane ideas, even ideals,
truths, and morality. Most of them are poems of the war, wonderful pen
pictures and silhouettes, such as “Town,” a London transformed by the
war as no picture or prose description could render it, ending,

  “It is well,
  That London, lair of sudden
  Male and female darknesses
  Has broken her spell.”

In previous volumes of poems, particularly in “Amores” and in “Look,
We Have Come Through,” he had published verse which was highly
appraised by competent critics, and hailed by a small group steeped in
preciosity, as epoch-making. However, if most of his poems have any
central or dominant idea, he is unable to express it. They are the
verbal manifestations of moods expressed symbolically, allegorically;
of sensuous desires, satisfactions, and satieties “seeking polarity,”
to borrow his favourite expression. Nearly everything is passion with
Mr. Lawrence, or suggestive of passion. The pure lily is a phallic
symbol, the bee sucking honey from a flower is a ravisher of innocence,
the earth itself bursts asunder periodically in the throes of secret
sensuality. Only the sea is free from the trammels of lust, and it is

  “Sworn to a high and splendid purposelessness
  Of brooding and delighting in the secret of life's going.”

“New Poems,” published in this country in 1920, did not fame or defame
him, although “Piano,” “Intime,” “Sickness,” and “Twenty Years Ago”
might well have done the former, and “Seven Seals” the latter.

The lull did not last long, and it was only a lull before a storm,
a hurricane, a tornado which spent its force and destruction upon
the author and made him the outlaw, if not the outcast, of English
literature. “Women in Love” is the adventure of two sisters, Ursula
and Gudrun Brangwen, the Brangwens whose frightful passions we have
now known for three generations, and two men of breeding, wealth,
and culture, Gerald Crich, a Sadist by inheritance and natural
inclination, and Rupert Birkin, an intellectual, apparently male, but
contradicted in this by his instinct and by his conduct, whose purpose
and ambition is to fall into the long African process of purely sensual
understanding.

The portrait of Rupert Birkin is superb. No excerpt could convey Mr.
Lawrence's capacity for characterisation as well as the paragraph which
describes him:

    “He was thin, pale and ill-looking. His figure was narrow but
    nicely made. He went with a slight trail of one foot, which
    came only from self-consciousness. His nature was clever and
    separate. He did not fit at all in the conventional occasion.
    He affected to be quite ordinary, perfectly and marvellously
    commonplace. And he did it so well, taking the tone of his
    surroundings, adjusting himself quickly to his interlocutor and
    his circumstance, that he achieved a verisimilitude of ordinary
    commonplaceness that usually propitiated his onlookers for a
    moment, disarmed them from attacking his singleness. He did not
    believe in any standards of behaviour though they are necessary
    for the common ruck. Anyone who is anything can be just himself
    and do as he likes. One should act spontaneously on one's
    impulses--it's the only gentlemanly thing to do, provided you
    are fit to do it.”

Hermione Roddice, daughter of a Derbyshire baron, a tall slow reluctant
woman, with a weight of fair hair and pale long face that she carries
lifted up in the Rossetti fashion, and that seems almost drugged as if
a strange mass of thoughts coil in the darkness within her allowing her
no escape, is in love with him. “She needed conjunction with Rupert
Birkin to make her whole and, she believed, happy. But the more she
strove to bring him to her, the more he battled her back.”

Gerald Crich, whose gleaming beauty and maleness is like a young
good-natured smiling wolf, flashes upon Gudrun Brangwen and she
succumbs at once, just as the Polish lady did when Gudrun's grandfather
got sight of her from the tail of his eye. The first time Gerald and
Rupert meet “There was a pause of strange enmity between the two men
that was very near to love.” Going up in the train to London together,
they have a talk about ideals, the object and aim of life. This gives
Rupert time to formulate his thought that Humanity does not embody the
utterance of the incomprehensible any more. Humanity is a dead letter.
There will be a new embodiment in a new way. Let humanity disappear as
quickly as possible. They are introduced into bohemia; that is, the
haunts of the semi-abandoned and the perverted. Birkin shares a flat
with Halliday, a degenerate “with a moving beauty of his own,” and his
friends. Just how far this group expresses Mr. Lawrence's own views
of art and philosophy, in their discussion of wood carvings of the
primitive negroes of West Africa, we need not attempt to estimate, but
that need not deter us from saying that the description of a gathering
around the fireplace in a state of complete nudity is indecent and
disgusting, even though Mr. Lawrence thinks this kind of thing marks a
milestone on the way to that which he calls “Allness.”

A large portion of the book is, in my judgment, obscene, deliberately,
studiously, incessantly obscene. Obscenity, like everything else, has
its gradations, its intensities, its variations, and the author of this
book knows how to ring the changes upon obscenity in a way that would
make Aretino green with envy. For instance, the so-called wrestling
scene between Rupert and Gerald is the most obscene narrative that I
have encountered in the English language--obscene in the etymological
sense, for it is ill-omened, hence repulsive; and in the legal sense,
for it tends to corrupt the mind and to subvert respect for decency
and morality. The major part of Hermione's conduct with Rupert is in
the realm of perversion, and Rupert in his speech to her conveys by
innuendo what Mr. Lawrence knows the laws of his country would not
permit him to say directly. The Marquis de Sade was a mere novice
in depicting the transports of lust that result from inflicting
injury or causing humiliation compared with Mr. Lawrence; and as for
Sacher-Masoch, who worked on the other side of the shield, he merely
staked out the claim for a young Britisher to cultivate.

Hermione says that if we could only realise that in the spirit we are
all one, all equal in spirit, all brothers there, the rest would not
matter. There would then be no more struggle for power and prestige,
the things which now destroy. This drives Rupert to violence. He denies
it savagely. We are alike in everything _save_ spirit. In the spirit he
is as separate as one star from another; as different in quality and
quantity. Establish a state on that. This destroys the last vestige of
Hermione's restraint and facilitates the consummation of voluptuous
ecstasy at last. With a beautiful ball of lapis lazuli, a paper weight,
she smashes his skull while he is sitting in her boudoir.

A second blow would have broken his neck had he not shied it with a
volume of Thucydides (a deft touch to make the immortal Greek save the
prototype of the Superman that Mr. Lawrence is introducing while he
buries Greek idealism).

    “She must smash it, it must be smashed before her ecstasy was
    consummated, fulfilled forever. A thousand lives, a thousand
    deaths matters nothing now, only the fulfilment of this perfect
    ecstasy.”

But he gets away from her.

“Then she staggered to the couch, and lay down, and went heavily to
sleep”; and he wanders into the wet hillside that is overgrown and
obscure with bushes and flowers. Here Mr. Lawrence gives a classic
description of masochistic lust.

    “He took off his clothes and sat down naked among the primroses
    ... but they were too soft. He went through the long grass to
    a clump of young fir trees, that were no higher than a man.
    The soft-sharp boughs beat upon him, as he moved in keen pangs
    against them, threw little cold showers of drops on his belly,
    and beat his loins with their clusters of soft-sharp needles.
    There was a thistle which pricked him vividly, but not too much,
    because all his movements were discriminate and soft. To lie
    down and roll in the sticky young hyacinths, to lie on one's
    belly and cover one's back with handfuls of fine wet grass, soft
    as a breath, softer and more delicate and more beautiful than
    the touch of any woman; and then to sting one's thighs against
    the living dark bristles of the fir-boughs; and then to feel
    the light whip of the hazel on one's shoulders, stinging, and
    then to clasp the silvery birch trunk against one's breast, its
    smoothness, its hardness, its vital knots and ridges--this was
    good, this was all very good, very satisfying.”

And this is the man who Mr. Lawrence would have us believe was
Inspector of Schools in England in the beginning of the Twentieth
Century! The idea that he wants a woman is now absurd. This is his idea
of bliss. He knows where to plant himself, his seed: along with the
trees in the folds of the delicious fresh-growing leaves. This is his
place, his marriage place.

It may interest Mr. Lawrence to know that this procreative idea of
Birkin's is not original with him. Many years ago I encountered a
man in the Kings Park State Hospital who was of the same belief and
addicted to the same practice.

It would not be convincing if only æsthetes, intelligentsia, artists,
and the like had revolutionary ideas. Gerald, a man of business, an
executive, a coal baron, aggressive, capable, also had them, inherited
from his mother, acquired from Birkin and “made in Germany” where he
had been sent to school. He makes love to Ursula by expounding his
theories of life:

    “If only man was swept off the face of the earth, creation would
    go on so marvellously, with a new start, non-human. Man is one
    of the mistakes of creation--like the ichthyosauri. If only we
    were gone again, think what lovely things would come out of the
    liberated days; things straight out of the fire.”

He wants her without contract, understood or stated:

    “There is a final me which is stark and impersonal and beyond
    responsibility. So there is a final you. And it is there
    I should want to meet you--not in the emotional, loving
    plane--but there beyond, where there is no speech and no terms
    of agreement. There we are two stark, unknown beings, two
    utterly strange creatures. I should want to approach you and
    you me.--And there could be no obligation, because there is no
    standard for action there, because no understanding has been
    reaped from that plane. It is quite inhuman--so there can be no
    calling to book, in any form whatsoever--because one is outside
    the pale of all that is accepted, and nothing known applies. One
    can only follow the impulse, take that which lies in front, and
    responsible for nothing, asked for nothing, giving nothing, only
    each taking according to the primal desire.”

In other words, sheer savagery, and the worst African variety at that!

One of Mr. Lawrence's obsessions is that he can distinguish between
the sexual writhings of his characters, depending upon the environment
in which they writhe and the immediate exciting cause. This justifies
him in describing the same writhe over and over with a different
setting. Of the five hundred pages, at least one hundred are devoted
to descriptions of the sensations that precede and accompany ecstasy
provoked and induced by some form of unhealthy sexual awareness.

It is impossible to give even a brief synopsis of “Women in Love.” One
chapter, however, must be mentioned, for in a way it is the crux of the
book. For some time Birkin has been trying to state his case to Ursula
and stave off her clamour for consummation. He wants sex to revert
to the level of the other appetites, to be regarded as a functional
process, not as fulfilment. He wants her to give him her spirit.

    “He knew he did not want further sensual experience, he thought.
    His mind reverted to the African statues in Halliday's rooms.
    They displayed their thousand upon thousand of years of sensual
    knowledge, purely unspiritual. Thousands of years ago that
    which was imminent in himself must have taken place in these
    Africans. This is what was imminent in him; the goodness, the
    holiness, the desire for creation and productive happiness
    must have lapsed, leaving the single impulse for knowledge in
    one sort, mindless, progressive knowledge through the senses,
    knowledge arrested and ending in the senses, mystic knowledge in
    disintegration and dissolution. Is the day of our creative life
    finished or are we not ready for the sensual understanding, the
    knowledge in the mystery of dissolution? The man Ursula would
    take must be quaffed to the dregs by her, he must render himself
    up to her. She believed that love surpassed the individual. She
    believed in an absolute surrender to love. He didn't.”

They then have a violent verbal altercation in which Ursula tells
him what she thinks of his obscenity and perverseness in words that
admit of no misunderstanding. She then leaves him in a state of wrath
and resentment after having thrown the topaz engagement ring, bought
from a second-hand dealer, in his face. But her ardour conquers her
righteousness and she goes back to him, saying, “See what a flower I
found you.” And then it is settled quietly and as if they were normal
humans. They go to a hotel and there they have super-corporeal contact
that beggars description. As far as can be made out, there is no
consortion in the ordinary sense. It is neither love nor passion.

    “She had established a rich new circuit, a new current of
    passional electric energy, between the two of them released
    from the darkest poles of the body and established in
    perfect circuit, and she had done this in some mysterious
    ways by tracing the back of his thighs with her sensitive
    fingertips, his mysterious loins and his thighs. Something more
    mystically-physically satisfying than anything she had imagined
    or known--though she had had some experience--was realised. She
    had thought that there was no source deeper than the phallic
    source, but now from the strange marvellous flanks and thighs
    came the flood of ineffable darkness and ineffable riches.”

They laughed and went to the meal provided. And this is what they had:

    “There was a venison pasty, of all things, a large broad-faced
    cut ham, eggs and cresses, and red beet root, and medlars and
    apple tart, and tea.”

There is a deep, dark significance in this meal, which the Freudian
will understand perfectly, but which to the uninitiated will seem quite
meaningless, even after Ursula says, “What _good_ things. How noble it
looks.”

There is a lot more about the full mystic knowledge that she gets from
his suave loins of darkness, the strange, magical current of force in
his back and his loins, that fills with nausea. They finish by driving
to Sherwood Forest, taking all their clothes off and beginning anew
their effort for fulfilment.

    “She was to him what he was to her, the immemorial magnificence
    of mystic, palpable, real utterance.”

I have neither the strength nor the inclination to follow Gudrun in her
search for her amatory _Glückeritter_, or to hear further exposition of
the _credo_ of the strange freak of nature that Mr. Lawrence strives
to apotheosise. Suffice it to say that the precious quartette go off
to the Tyrol, Ursula and Birkin having gone through the formality of
marriage; Gudrun and Gerald dispensing with it. And there Gudrun begins
writhings which are designed to put all the others in the shade. And in
a way they do, because Gerald's violent death is required to facilitate
her supreme moment. They introduce a super-degenerate Loerke, a
sculptor, who represents the rock bottom of all life to Gudrun.

    “There was the look of a little wastrel about him that intrigued
    her, and an old man's look, that interested her, and then,
    besides this, an uncanny singleness, that marked out an artist
    to her. He had come up from a street Arab. He was twenty-six,
    had thieved, sounded every depth. He saw in Gudrun his
    soul-mate. He knew her with a subconscious, sinister knowledge,
    devoid of illusions and hopes. The degradation of his early
    life also attracted her. He seemed to be the very stuff of
    the underworld of life. There was no going beyond him. Birkin
    understood why they should like him, the little obscene monster
    of the darkness that he is. He is a Jew who lives like a rat, in
    the river of corruption.”

Birkin and Ursula come back for Gerald's funeral. Birkin does some
soliloquising, the burden of which is “He should have loved me. I
offered him.” He is sure Gerald would have been happy if he had
accepted. When Ursula wants to know if she is not enough for him, he
says,

    “No, to make life complete, really complete, I wanted eternal
    union with a man too, another kind of love.”

    “It is a perversity,” she said.

    “Well----,” he said.

    “You can't have two kinds of love. Why should you?” she said.

    “It seems as if I can't,” he said. “Yet I wanted it.”

    “You can't have it because it's wrong, impossible,” she said.

    “I don't believe that,” he answered.

And that is the unvarying and final answer of the advocates of the
enigmatic aberration whose doctrines Mr. Lawrence is trying to foist
upon an unsuspecting English-reading public.

In “Aaron's Rod” Mr. Lawrence returns to the theme of “The Rainbow”
and “Women in Love.” His ardour, fortunately, has cooled somewhat, but
his psychology is more at variance with facts and his philosophy more
mystic than in either of these. Aaron Sisson, a miner's checkweighman,
with a talent for music, marries when twenty, an over-sexed young woman
of better social position than himself. Though he soon betrays her,
they manage to live, with their three children, an average family life
for twelve years. He then determines that he will not be the instrument
and furnisher of any woman. He rebels against the sacrament by which we
live today; namely, that man is the giver, woman the receiver. He can
not and will not tolerate the life centrality of woman. Man's contact
with woman should be for procreational purposes, but man should blend
his spirit with man: “Born in him was a spirit which could not worship
woman, and would not.”

So he sets up the Christmas tree for the children, goes out to buy
candles for it, and never returns. Instead, he falls in with a
family group of inverts which the little mining towns always seem to
have--a man of perverted type; his fiancée, a Lesbian, the daughter
of a promiscuous Hermione and her complaisant husband; and several
others--and they proceed to have a mild orgy in the ugly midland
mining town, “in which it is remarkable how many odd or extraordinary
people there are to be found.” Aaron gets a position as flutist in an
orchestra, and at the opera he meets Mr. Lilly, who, though married, is
by nature of inverted genesic instinct. He is Aaron's downfall.

It is to be noted that there is a deep symbolism in the names that
Mr. Lawrence selects for his heroes and heroines. Aaron is sure
that he never wanted to surrender himself to his wife, nor to his
mother, nor to anybody. But he falls ill, and Lilly cares for him and
nurses him like a mother, and then goes off to Italy--Aaron after
him like a hound after the scent. We are introduced to a choice lot
of males in Florence, all portraits of exiled Britishers who find
it suits their tastes, which their country calls their infirmities,
to live there, and easily recognisable by anyone who has lived in
Florence. We are regaled with their philosophy and with Mr. Lawrence's
reflections on art and Sixteenth Century music. Finally, to show
Aaron's charm and concupiscense, the author throws a modern brooding
Cleopatra--Anthony-less--across his path. She is an American woman
from the Southern States whose father was once Ambassador to France.
Aaron capitulates at the second interview and then despises himself.
But again he falls a few days later, and then he realises that there
is nothing left for him but flight, flight to Lilly and abandonment of
the love idea and the love motive. Life submission is his duty now,
and when he looks up into Lilly's face, at the moment resembling a
Byzantine Eikon, and asks, “And to whom shall I submit?” the reply
comes, “Your soul will tell you.”

And my soul tells me that he who submits himself to reading the
doctrines promulgated by D. H. Lawrence deserves his punishment.
Moreover, I maintain that, both from the artistic and the psychological
standpoints, Mr. Lawrence's performances are those of a neophyte and a
duffer. He can make words roar and sing and murmur, and by so doing he
can make moral, poised, God-fearing, sentiment-valuing man creep and
shudder, indeed, almost welcome the obscurity of the grave, so that he
will not have to meet his fellow again in the flesh. He libels and he
bears false witness against man. There are persons in the world such
as Mr. Lawrence describes. So are there lepers and lunatics. We do not
talk about them as if the whole world were made up of them; and we do
not confidently look for world reformers or world orderers among them.

Mr. Lawrence is a self-appointed crusader who is going to destroy
European civilisation and at the same time revivify that of six
thousand and more years ago. He is the most shining avatar of mysticism
the Twentieth Century has yet produced, and the most daring champion
of atavism in twenty centuries. He is using a medium to facilitate his
manifestations and embodiments of which he is a consummate master,
viz., fiction. But his statements, both when he uses the language of
science, and when he uses that of fiction, are at variance with truth
and fact; and he has not furnished, nor can he furnish, a particle
of evidence to substantiate his thesis: enhancement of the awareness
and potency “of that other basic mind, the deepest physical mind” by
sensuous satisfaction or through sexual ecstasy. His “broodings and
delightings in the secret of life's goings” are anathema.

During the past decade biology has accumulated a convincing amount of
evidence to show that sex intergrades, or imperfect sex separation and
differentiation frequently exist, and furthermore it may be produced
experimentally. These facts justify the belief that individuals
with the convictions and conduct of Birkin result from a definite
developmental condition, which is the fundamental cause of the peculiar
sex reactions. Such persons are actually different from fully expressed
males or females, and their peculiar condition is permanent, present
from childhood to old age, and uninfluenceable by any measures;
pedagogy or punishment, mandate or medicine.

My experience as a psychologist and alienist has taught me that
pornographic literature is created by individuals whose genesic
endowment is subnormal _ab initio_, or exhausted from one cause or
another before nature intended that it should be, and that those who
would aid God and nature in the ordering of creation are sterile, or
approximately so. This is a dispensation for which we cannot be too
grateful.

There are two ways of contemplating Mr. Lawrence's effort. Has he a
fairly clear idea of what he is trying to say, of what he is trying
to put over; or is he a poetic mystic groping in abysmal darkness? I
am one of those who is convinced that he knows just what he wants to
accomplish, and that he could make a statement of it in language that
anyone could understand, did the censor permit him. Public opinion
is adequate to deal with the infractions of taste and ethics that he
has perpetrated, and it is quite safe to leave him finally to that
judiciary.

Mr. Lawrence once wrote, “The Americans are not worthy of their
Whitman. Miracle that they have not annihilated every word of him.” To
which I would make rejoinder, “The Britishers have not deserved D. H.
Lawrence. Pity it is that they do not annihilate every trace of him.”

Ten years have gone since Henry James, walking up and down the charming
garden of his picturesque villa in Rye, discussing the most promising
successors of Hardy, Meredith, and Conrad, said to me, “The world is
sure to hear from a young man, D. H. Lawrence.” It has heard from him.
He has sown in glory and raised in corruption. He has triumphed,
and his triumph has stained English literature. He has debased an
unusual talent and devoted his splendid endowment of artistry to
spoking the wheel of evolutionary progress, even to spinning it in a
reverse direction. He has arrived, and in arriving has brought with
him a sweltering, suffocating South African atmosphere, difficult
and dangerous for one of his former admirers to breathe, who as he
withdraws from it ventures to call the attention of others to its
noxiousness.




                              CHAPTER XII
    THE JOY OF LIVING--AND WRITING ABOUT IT: JOHN ST. LOE STRACHEY


Twenty-five years ago, browsing among the second-hand book-shops of
Shaftesbury Avenue, my attention was arrested by a sombre volume
entitled “From Grave to Gay,” by J. St. Loe Strachey.

Until then I had not heard of Mr. Strachey, and though I admit it with
reluctance, I had not even heard of his famous cousin, Henry Strachey,
who was private secretary to Lord Clive. But the subtitle of his
book: “Concerned with Certain Subjects of Serious Interest, with the
Puritans, with Literature and with the Humours of Life, Now for the
First Time Collected and Arranged,” intrigued me. Those were the very
subjects, I had convinced myself, with which I was concerned, for did
they not give spice to life and make for surcease of its burdens? “Now
for the First Time Collected and Arranged” I construed to be a belief
on the part of the writer that from time to time he could substitute
for the word “first” the other numerals in progressive order. Whether
or not he has been able to do so, I have not determined, but every
one knows that he became “editor and sole proprietor” of the London
_Spectator_ and has occupied a conspicuous place in journalism for
the past quarter of a century. And now he recounts his life, or such
parts of it as seem to him will permit others to understand how and
why he has carried on, and he calls it “The Adventure of Living: A
Subjective Autobiography,” stressing “the influences that have affected
my life and for good or evil made me what I am.” He emphasises that the
interesting thing about a human being is not what he is, but how he
came to be what he is, which naturally includes what he does and why he
does it.

Mr. Strachey came to be what he is from his heredity, aided and
guided--after it had formulated itself in the organism to which, a few
months later, the name John St. Loe was given--by Mrs. Salome Leaker,
the family nurse. Once the reader gets her name out of the realm of
risibility, he falls in love with her. A face radiant with a vivid
intelligence, a nature eager and active, a fiery temper--reserved
almost entirely for grown-ups--an appreciation for good literature and
art, which, although she had been brought up in illiteracy, she had
developed by self-education and “threw quotations from the English
classics around her in a kind of hailstorm,” supplemented a genuine
love of children and abounding common sense.

    “There was no nonsense in her nursery as to over-exciting our
    minds or emotions, or that sort of thing. She was quite prepared
    to read us to sleep with the witches in 'Macbeth' or the death
    scene in 'Othello.' I can see her now, with her wrinkled, brown
    face, her cap with white streamers awry over her black hair
    beginning to turn grey. In front of her was a book, propped up
    against the rim of a tin candlestick shaped like a small basin.
    In it was a dip candle with a pair of snuffers. That was how
    nursery light was provided in the later 'sixties and even in
    the 'seventies. As she sat bent forward, declaiming the most
    soul-shaking things in Shakespeare between nine and ten at
    night, we lay in our beds with our chins on the counterpane,
    silent, scared, but intensely happy. We loved every word and
    slept quite well when the play was over.”

The pen picture of Mrs. Salome Leaker, and the photograph, are of the
book's best. It is not unlikely that Mr. Strachey owes his worldly
success and pleasure quite as much to his nurse as to “the famous men,
and our fathers who begat us,” of whom his father, “though without a
trace of anything approaching pride, was never tired of talking.”

[Illustration: J. ST. LOE STRACHEY] From a drawing by _W. Rothenstein._

In his early childhood he was subject to occasional experiences--a
sense of spiritual isolation with poignancy amounting to awe. Although
he devotes several pages to them he does not succeed in describing
his sensations, but in characterising them. One day while standing
in a passage he suddenly had a sensation of being alone, not merely
in the house, but in the world, the universe. With this came a sense
of exaltation and magnification of personality so ample that it was
difficult to describe. He felt then, though he was only six, that his
soul had become naked. The effect on him was intensely awe-inspiring,
so much so as to be disturbing in a high degree. Though not terrified,
he experienced a kind of rawness and sensitiveness of soul, such as
when a supersensitive mucous membrane is touched roughly by a hand or
instrument. In addition to this awe and sensitiveness, was a sudden
realisation of the appalling greatness of the issues of living, not
only of the imminence but of the ineffable greatness of the whole of
which he was a part. He felt that what he was “in for” as a sentient
human being was immeasurably great. It was thence that the sense of
awe came, thence the extraordinary sensitiveness, thence the painful
exhilaration, the spiritual sublimation. “As a human being I was not
only immortal but _capax imperii_,--a creature worthy of a heritage so
tremendous.”

Mr. Strachey defines his state as one of _isolement_, and further
defines it as ecstasy. The latter term has probably been borrowed from
current psychoanalytic terminology. It is purely a subjective term, and
as this is a subjective autobiography, satisfies his needs, though it
puts us only a little way on the road to understanding.

No objective description of this state has been worked out. A
scheme for it would be elaborate and require more patience than the
behaviourists have so far displayed. They know some things in an exact
way about organic reactions to simplified laboratory situations. They
have never followed out the life history of any of the reactions
they describe, either exactly or in tentative descriptive terms.
Autobiographic writings furnish rich material for an objective
psychologist. Mr. Strachey, for instance, has an unusual memory,
has never suffered any serious breaks in his reaction system, and
would seem not to be subject to any wealth of parallel reactions.
The objective psychologists may, in the not distant future, work
out a description of _isolement_ in terms of organic reactions, and
their life histories in terms of organic memory. I do not see how a
highly organised intelligence in such a setting--reminiscent father,
tradition-ladened background, cultivated and uncultivated mysticism of
his nurse--could have failed to develop some such moments.

It is quite likely that the main outlines of Mr. Strachey's
intelligence as a working mechanism had been laid down, even at this
early age. It was said of him that when a little more than two and a
half years old, when his family was starting on a long journey to Pau,
he insisted that his father should take with him Spenser's “Faerie
Queene!” He must have had in late childhood a rich freight of memories.
An elaborate and delicate set of reaction mechanism, spontaneously
called forth these definite movements of detachment in the interests
of further internal organisation. Moreover, it seems to me entirely a
normal experience, in view of the fact that there was so much incentive
to fantasy and so little progress beyond mere normal ecstasy.
It is a fearsome thing to contemplate how little fruit the arrival of
powers of abstraction bring with them. Immediately Mr. Strachey was
plunged into the artificial region of letters and politics, he made no
effective contacts with scientific and social thinking of his period.
His whole mental career from this standpoint was a gradually elaborated
detachment, significant mainly for its richness, brilliancy, and
generally prevailing consistency.

One other psychic experience he records, a dream during an afternoon
nap: His wife came to him with a telegram in her hand which related
that his son had been killed in a hunting accident in France. The
incident of this telepathic dream from the objective standpoint is not
very significant. The dreamer had plenty of reasons for apprehension
over the welfare of his son, who was in a country where hazards were of
frequent enough occurrence to make some time identity between dream and
occurrence possible. The form of the hazard in the dream could probably
have been traced at the time to some recent event or hearsay, and was
gratuitously attached to the state of apprehension which came to the
surface in the dream state.

The story of one who for a third of a century has been in British
journalism while the world was being recast and remoulded must of
necessity be rich in the raw material of “human interest,” as well as
of history and politics. But it is not this material which the author
of the subjective autobiography has chosen to present. It is with the
adventure of his own life that he would interest the reader. He says,

    “Every life is an adventure, and if a sense of this adventure
    cannot become communicated to the reader, any one may feel sure
    that it is the fault of the writer, not of the facts.”

He quotes Sir Thomas Browne's advice to a son about to write an account
of his travels in Hungary

    “not to trouble about methods of extracting iron and copper from
    the ores, or with a multitude of facts and statistics, but not
    to forget to give a full description of the 'Roman alabaster
    tomb in the barber's shop at Pesth.'”

The alabaster tomb in the barber's shop, rather than high politics
or even high literature, is the goal which he has set before him in
writing this book. The test by which he invites judgment of it is the
power to enthrall the imagination of the reader with the sense of
adventure.

The “supreme good luck to be born the second son of a Somersetshire
squire and to be brought up in a Somersetshire country-house” was
reinforced by the influence of parents to whose qualities he pays
tribute in a chapter devoted to memories of his parents, and in another
devoted to the stories told him as a child by his father. These stories
serve to cloak the genealogical facts that always flavour so keenly,
to the adventurer himself, the zest of his adventure. In this case
they leave the reader free to trace, should he possess a relish for
such a trail, through the rattling rust of ancient armour, the spell
of great country houses and other symbols of authority. One may also
trace Mr. Strachey's hereditary urge for literature, for there was a
certain ancestor who “almost certainly knew Shakespeare” and “had a
considerable amount of book-writing to his credit,” including “two or
three pamphlets written by him and published as what we should now call
'Virginia Company propaganda.'” No light is thrown upon the heritage,
guardian angel, or kind fate which was responsible for providing the
adventurer at the outset of his journey with the most fortunate of all
possessions, the temperament to “take the good the gods provide,” and
for relieving him of all encumbrances in the way of “inferiority” and
other complexes, which have become so fashionable a part of the modern
adventurer's equipment.

If, indeed, anything in the way of good fortune was wanting in the
gifts of fate to the author of the autobiography, he was more than
compensated by a disposition which made it easy for him to appreciate
the good qualities of others, even of his mother-in-law--that usually
most unappreciated of all human relations--and to live in unimpaired
serenity in her family. Of her we are told that

    “she was an admirable talker and full of clear and interesting
    memories. I had no sooner entered the Simpson house and family
    than I found that there were a hundred points of sympathy
    between us. She had known everybody in London who was worth
    knowing ... and had visited most of the political country
    houses in England on the Whig side, and most of the neutral
    strongholds.”

Aside from the chapters on his parents and old nurse, only a few
glimpses are given of a normal and happy childhood passed in the
good old days when ladies still had time to cultivate the art of
correspondence--of which he says, “I have no time to dwell on my
mother's most intimate friendship with Lady Waldegrave and with their
habit of writing daily letters to each other.” The salient point of his
childhood seems to be that he was saturated with precocity and filial
piety. He was not quite so strong as other boys and was not sent to
public school, and “the irony of accident,” he says, “had designed my
mental equipment to be of a kind perfectly useless for the purposes
of the preliminary Oxford examinations.” Knowledge of literature, a
power of writing, a not inconsiderable reading in modern history, and
a commendable grasp of mathematics were of no use whatever for the
purpose of matriculation. So the youthful Strachey turned to Latin and
Greek and finally entered Balliol as an unattached student. The first
discord in the harmony of his relations with life was sounded when he
became a student at Balliol, where he did not get on well with the Dons.

    “I can say truthfully that I never received a word of
    encouragement, of kindly direction, or of sympathy of any sort
    or kind from any of them in regard to work or anything else. The
    reason, I now feel sure, was that they believed that to take
    notice of me would have only made me more uppish.”

His recollections of Jowett, the Master of Balliol, are tempered by the
successes and the good fortune that have come to him in the intervening
forty years, but he remains convinced that “the Master of Balliol
evidently felt the Stracheyphobia very strongly, or perhaps I should
say felt it his duty to express it very strongly.” The sarcasm that
Jowett poured upon him on his return to Balliol after his first year
as an unattached student still rankles. But in those early days there
must have been an atmosphere of self-sufficiency, complacency, possibly
one might be justified in saying conceit, that dissolved the testy
Master's inhibitions.

Mr. Strachey is never tired of emphasising the good fortune of his
friendships.

    “I have no doubt I was considered odd by most of my
    contemporaries, but this oddness and also my inability to play
    football or cricket never seemed to create, as far as I could
    see, any prejudice. Indeed I think that my friends were quite
    discerning enough and quite free enough from convention to be
    amused and interested by a companion who was not built up in
    accordance with the sealed pattern.”

Nothing better illustrates his mental endowment and his cultural
equipment as estimated by himself than this statement:

    “In my day we would talk about anything, from the Greek feeling
    about landscape to the principles the Romans would have taken
    as the basis of actuarial tables, if they had had them. We
    unsphered Plato, we speculated as to what Euripides would have
    thought of Henry James, or whether Sophocles would have enjoyed
    Miss ----'s acting, and felt that it was of vital import to
    decide these matters.”

Good old days, indeed! We can imagine what the fate of the student at
Harvard, let us say, would be today if he shaped his talk to indicate
that “the most important thing in the world” was talk of this kind.

At an early age Mr. Strachey yielded to the urge of poetry writing, and
even had a book of verses printed by a local publisher, of which he
says:

    “The thing that strikes me most, on looking back at my little
    volume of verse, is its uncanny competence, not merely from the
    point of view of prosody, but of phraseology and what I may
    almost term scholarship.”

_Omne ignotum pro magni-_ (or _miri_) _fico_. In spite of this he felt
no great desire to adopt poetry-making as his profession.

    “Possibly I thought the trade was a bad one for a second son who
    must support himself. It is more probable that I instinctively
    felt that although it was so great a source of joy to me,
    poetry was not my true vocation. Perhaps, also, I had already
    begun to note the voice of pessimism raised by the poets of the
    seventies, and to feel that they did not believe in themselves.”

“The pivot of my life has been _The Spectator_, and so _The Spectator_
must be the pivot of my book.” His connection with it began when he was
about twenty-six, after he had settled in London to study for the Bar.
The book opens with an account of the spectacular success of his first
adventure of writing for this journal. Armed with a formal introduction
from his father, who had been a friend of the joint editors, Mr. Hutton
and Mr. Townsend, and a frequent contributor to the paper, Mr. Strachey
called at _The Spectator_ office in Wellington Street and listened to
the well-worn story--no less true thirty years ago than it is today--of
“more outside reviewers than they could possibly find work for,” and
received, out of friendship for his father alone, the choice of five
volumes to notice. One of them was an edition of “Gulliver's Travels,”
and it was destined to play a leading rôle in the adventure of John
St. Loe Strachey. Nothing daunted by the indifferent encouragement,
he promptly despatched the completed reviews, and in due time again
presented himself at the office for the sole purpose of returning the
books. Great was his amazement when, instead of a lukewarm reception,
he was immediately asked to select anything he would like to review,
from a new pile of books. When he protested that he had not come to ask
for more books to review, he learned that the position of the editors
had been entirely changed by the review of “Gulliver's Travels,” and
“they hoped very much that I should be able to do regular work for _The
Spectator_. I was actually hailed as 'a writer and critic of the first
force.'” Even a stronger head might have been turned by such praise
from such a source.

This, however, was only the first chapter of his successful adventure
with _The Spectator_. Shortly afterwards, he received a letter from Mr.
Hutton asking him to write a couple of leaders a week and some notes
while Mr. Townsend was away for a holiday. His first leader brought a
delighted response from Mr. Townsend, who requested him to remain as
his assistant while Mr. Hutton was away, and soon afterward suggested,

    “with a swift generosity that still warms my heart, that if
    I liked to give up the Bar, for which I was still supposing
    myself to be reading, I could have a permanent place at _The
    Spectator_, and even, if I remember rightly, hinted that I
    might look forward to succeeding the first of the two partners
    who died or retired, and so to becoming joint editor or joint
    proprietor.”

His second political leader, entitled the “Privy Council and the
Colonies,” brought down even bigger game than the first. Fate, always
the ally of Mr. Strachey, so arranged that Lord Granville, then
Colonial Secretary, had been prevented by a fit of gout from preparing
a speech which he was to deliver when he received the Agents-General of
the self-governing Colonies, and he supplied the hiatus by beginning
his speech with the words: “In a very remarkable article which appeared
in this week's _Spectator_”--and then going on “to use the article as
the foundation of his speech,” with the result that Mr. Hutton was
“greatly delighted, and almost said in so many words that it wasn't
every day that the editors of _The Spectator_ could draw Cabinet
Ministers to advertise their paper.”

So the “first two leaders had done the trick.” Still, as the young
adventurer was soon to learn, it was possible for an aspirant to
success to get by both editors, and even a Cabinet Minister, and
still fail of entire recognition from the most critical member of
_The Spectator_ staff. Even this distinction, however, Mr. Strachey
was destined promptly to achieve. “The last, the complete rite of
initiation at _The Spectator_ office,” occurred one day as he was
talking over articles, when

    “a large, consequential, not to say stout black tom-cat slowly
    entered the room, walked around me, sniffed at my legs in
    a suspicious manner, and then, to my intense amazement and
    amusement, hurled himself from the floor with some difficulty
    and alighted upon my shoulder.... The sagacious beast had
    realised that there was a new element in the office, and
    had come to inspect it and see whether he could give it his
    approval. When that approval was given, it was conceded by all
    concerned that the appointment had received its consecration.”

And so, having received the unqualified endorsement of the office cat,
the future “editor and sole proprietor” of _The Spectator_, within a
few weeks of his introduction to the office, had his career mapped
out for him. That Mr. Strachey has been content with that career this
subjective autobiography is likely to convince the most sceptical.

Two chapters are devoted to an estimate of Meredith Townsend, who was
successively his chief, his partner, and later--after Mr. Strachey
became “sole proprietor and editor-in-chief”--merely leader-writer for
_The Spectator_. The sketch of Mr. Townsend, which will undoubtedly
appeal more to British than to American readers, is vivid and
sympathetic, bringing into high relief the rather picturesque side of
an altogether lovable and thoroughly practical personality--although
any weak points which he may have displayed as leader-writer are not
blurred over. His fairness, both toward his junior partner and toward
those who differed with him, is emphasised, as well as his sound
philosophy, his wit, his capacity for felicitous epigram, and his
mental directness and forcefulness.

Mr. Strachey has the same pleasure in recalling his early days with
_The Spectator_ that the aged courtesan is alleged to have in telling
of her youthful _amours_.

    “When an occasion like this makes me turn back to my old
    articles, I am glad to say that my attitude, far from being one
    of shame, is more like that of the Duke of Wellington. When
    quite an old man, somebody brought him his Indian dispatches to
    look over. As he read, he is recorded to have muttered: 'Damned
    good! I don't know how the devil I ever managed to write 'em.'”

When Mr. Strachey became “proprietor, editor, general manager,
leader-writer, and reviewer” of _The Spectator_ he naturally asked
himself: “What is the journalist's function in the State, and how am
I to carry it out?” After reflection and deliberation he decided that
the journalist must be the watch-dog of society, and this in full
recognition of the fact that the watch-dog is generally disliked, often
misunderstood, and burdened with a disagreeable job, even with its
compensations. He defends the watch-dog for barking,

    “in a loud and raucous way, even for biting occasionally. It is
    good for the dog and it is good for the one who is barked at or
    bitten, though the latter, like the boy who is being flogged for
    his good, neither sees it nor admits it.”

Mr. Strachey recites a specific instance of his watch-dog methods in
dealing with Cecil Rhodes, whose methods of expanding the British
Empire seemed to _The Spectator_ dangerous and inconsistent with the
sense of national honour and good faith. He therefore

    “warned the British public that Rhodes, if not watched, would
    secretly buy policies behind their backs and that the party
    machine, when in want of money, would with equal secrecy sell
    them. And I proved my point, incredible as it may seem.”

Mr. Strachey says that he could, of course, mention other examples of
the way in which this particular watch-dog gave trouble and got himself
heartily disliked, but recounting them would touch living people. Mr.
Strachey does not bow the knee to archaic conventions like “_De mortuis
nil nisi bonum_.”

Next to the watch-dog function of the journalist is that of publicity.
Publicity is one of the pillars of society, and while this has long
been recognised in America, Mr. Strachey says, it is only very recently
that it has come to be thoroughly appreciated in his country. Publicity
is as important a thing as the collection and preservation of evidence
at a trial, but it is not the whole of journalism. Comment is an
important part, and infinitely more important apparently in Britain
than in this country. The journalism of comment may be divided into two
parts: judicial, and the journalism of advocacy. It is the former that
Mr. Strachey has practised or that he has meant to practise.

On the ethics of newspaper proprietorship he thinks that it makes for
soundness that newspaper proprietors should be pecuniarily independent.
It is also most important that they should be men whose money is
derived from their newspapers, and not from other sources. A great
newspaper in the hands of a man who does not look to it for profit, but
owns it for external reasons, is a source of danger. In view of this
opinion, it is interesting to recall that the control of the greatest
newspaper in the world has recently passed, in great part, into the
hands of a man who possesses a considerable portion of one of America's
greatest fortunes.

The chapters of Mr. Strachey's book which should have been most
interesting are those entitled “Five Great Men,” in which he discusses
Lord Cromer, John Hay, Theodore Roosevelt, Cecil Rhodes, and Joseph
Chamberlain. Many will find them the most disappointing, particularly
those who knew in the flesh any of these great men. They would be less
disappointing, perhaps, if they were not so palpably self-laudatory.
Mr. Strachey had a profound admiration for Lord Cromer and he shared it
with thousands of his countrymen and Egyptian well-wishers the world
over. Recalling a visit to Lord Cromer in Cairo, he says:

    “Inexperienced as I then was in public affairs, it was a matter
    of no small pleasure and of no small amount of pride to find my
    own special opinions, views, and theories as to political action
    plainly endorsed by an authority so great. In not a single case
    was I disappointed or disillusioned either with what had been my
    own views or with what were Lord Cromer's.”

This reminds strangely of Mr. Strachey's opinion of the Dons in his
youthful days at Oxford. Future biographers of Lord Cromer will have
to note the fact that “he was, with the single exception of my cousin,
Lytton Strachey, the most competent reviewer I ever had,” and that
“he wrote a review every week for _The Spectator_ on some important
book,” also that “he took an immense amount of trouble to realise and
understand _The Spectator_ view, and to commit me to nothing which he
thought I might dislike.”

In the same way, Mr. Strachey tells with great relish how he won the
approval of Roosevelt with his tact and discretion when the President
invited him to be present at one of his Cabinet meetings, and of
Roosevelt's admiration when Mr. Strachey went with him in floods of
rain for a ride on a dark November evening. In curious contrast to his
statement that on this occasion he was mounted on a superb Kentucky
horse procured from the cavalry barracks, “a creature whose strength
and speed proved how well deserved is the reputation of that famous
breed,” is the photograph of Mr. Strachey on his pony at the end of
the chapter, from which one would not readily gather that he had been
selected by Mr. Roosevelt to accompany him “on these afternoon winter
rides” as a test of men.

Mr. Strachey says that the bed-rock of his political opinions is a
whole-hearted belief in the principles of democracy, and he defines
his conception of democracy as being

    “not devotion to certain abstract principles or views of
    communal life which have the label 'democratic' placed upon
    them, but a belief in the justice, convenience and necessity of
    ascertaining and abiding by the lawfully and constitutionally
    expressed Will of the Majority of the People.”

He states his belief in the referendum

    “in order to free us from the evils of log-rolling and other
    exigencies of the kind which Walt Whitman grouped under the
    general formula of 'the insolence of elected persons.'”

He admits, however, that a whole-hearted belief in the democratic
principles need not prevent one from having strong views on special
points of policy, and one of his special points of policy is in regard
to Ireland.

    “I objected to Home Rule as bad for the Empire, bad for the
    United Kingdom, and bad in an even extremer degree for Ireland
    herself. If, however, it should be determined that some measure
    of Home Rule must be passed, then the existence of the two
    Irelands must be recognised in any action which should be
    determined upon. When, therefore, the support which the Unionist
    party decided on giving to Mr. Lloyd George at the end of the
    war made some form of Home Rule seem almost inevitable, I
    strongly advocated the division of Ireland as the only way of
    avoiding a civil war in which the merits would be with Northern
    Ireland.”

One who comes to this delightful narrative as an admirer of the author
may feel, on taking leave of it, that what Mr. Strachey has said of a
famous fellow editor, William T. Stead, might also be said of him:

    “Stead, though a man of honest intent, and very great ability,
    was also a man of many failings, many ineptitudes, many
    prejudices and injustices. Further, there was an element of
    commonness in his mental attitude, as in his style.”

Yet this would not be quite fair or accurate. Mr. Strachey is a man
of honest intent and very great ability, but there is no element of
“commonness” in his mental attitude. His admirers would not admit that
he is a man of many failings and many injustices. The word “some”
should be substituted for “many,” in any case. But then there are his
pronunciamentos on Ireland and his recollections of Cecil Rhodes.




                             CHAPTER XIII
         THE KING OF GATH UNTO HIS SERVANT: MAGAZINE INSANITY


For one who has devoted a considerable portion of his life to a study
of the human mind in dissolution there are few things more diverting
than popular disquisitions on the subject of insanity. If popular
comments and interpretations regarding other subjects--world politics,
for instance--are as apropos and penetrating as are those on mental
disorder, the less readers are guided by them the more instructed they
may expect to be.

I have recently read in an important magazine an article entitled
“Up from Insanity” which has all the qualities that a contribution
intended to be instructive and helpful should not have. It reeks
with misinformation, not only misstatement of facts, but unwarranted
inferences and unjustifiable and illogical conclusions.

The Editor of that distinguished and dignified periodical says: “It
is a revealing narrative, genuine down to the latest detail.” And so
it is. It reveals the writer's incapacity to grasp the fundamental
principles of psychology, established experimentally and empirically,
and which have taken their place amongst the eternal truths of the
world; and it reveals that the writer, whether because of his previous
mental disorder, or willfully, is quite ignorant of what has been
accomplished by countless students and innumerable workers in the field
of psychiatry by way of throwing some light upon the mysteries of the
normal mind.

“I am almost a pioneer in the field of written experience of insanity,”
he writes; and yet Mr. Clifford Beers' book, “A Mind that Found
Itself,” and “The Autobiography of a Paranoic,” two comparatively
recent works that are most illuminating and have had a great effect
in concentrating the attention of the public on insanity as a social
problem, must have been known to him.

    “It is a privilege conferred upon few men in the world to return
    from the dark and weird adventure [meaning insanity] to live a
    normal life.”

Considering that upward of one-third of all insane individuals recover,
there is no other interpretation to be put upon this statement than
that the writer of it does not know whereof he speaks.

    “A friend of mine lost his mind from thinking too much about his
    income tax.”

This may be an attempt at facetiousness on the part of the writer.
No physician who has dealt with the insane has ever encountered an
individual made insane by “thinking too much.” If so, he has been
silent about it.

    “I suppose, first of all, you would like to know how it feels to
    be insane. Well, it is indeed a melancholy situation.”

It is, indeed, a melancholy situation if you have melancholia, but if
you have mania, and especially if you have certain forms in which your
self-appreciation is enhanced and your belief in your potencies and
possessions quickened to an immeasurable degree, it is far from being a
melancholy sensation. It is a sensation of power and possession which
renders its possessor incapable of believing that any such thing as
depression exists in the world.

    “Lately a movement has arisen to change the name of insane
    asylums to 'mental hospitals.' We now recognise former madmen
    as merely sick people. We used to think of insane people
    as wild-eyed humans gnawing at prison bars or raving in a
    straight-jacket.”

The casual reader might infer from this that “lately” means within
the past few years, and yet three generations have come and gone
since Conolly, Hack, Tuke and others initiated the movement which
accomplished this.

    “It was inconceivable to a well-known New York publisher that
    an insane man could play golf, go to Africa, or talk about his
    experiences.”

The mental and emotional make-up of “well-known New York publishers” is
enigmatic. There is general agreement on that point, but if there is
one amongst them who believes that an insane man cannot play golf, he
could readily divorce himself from the conviction by driving past any
hospital for the insane. There he will see a golf course and some of
the patients playing, though he will not be able to distinguish them
from “regular” golfers. As for an insane man talking about his golf
or his experiences in Africa, no New York publisher, well-known or
otherwise, would need proof to convince him that an insane man can do
that.

    “On my way through New York I called on a celebrated specialist
    who told me that I had only six months to live and told me to go
    out and hunt, roam the world and make the best of the passing
    hours. Six months later that great physician died insane.”

It is to be assumed that the celebrated specialist was a specialist
in diseases of the mind. If that is so, the writer is in error. No
celebrated alienist of New York has died insane within the past quarter
of a century. In the second place, there has never been a celebrated
alienist in New York who would fit the description,

    “forty, rich, famous, living in an elegant home amid exquisite
    surroundings on University Heights with his wife, one of the
    most beautiful women I ever looked upon, a statuesque blonde of
    astounding loveliness.”

save in the last qualification. Each one of them has had a beautiful
wife, but none “a statuesque blonde of astounding loveliness.”

If the writer consulted a physician who made that statement to him,
he had the misfortune not only to be insane himself but to seek the
counsel of a physician who was also insane.

The writer of the article says that he will attempt seriously to show
that the centre of the will is distinct from the centre of the mind,
and is a separately functioning organ; but in the stress of relating
his experiences he forgot to do so. In fact, there would be no more
satisfactory way of estimating his mental possessions and equilibrium
than from an examination of this written document.

Those who are experienced with the insane give great diagnostic weight
to their writings, not only the orthography and the syntax, but the
sequence of thought, the rhythm of expression, the continuity of
narrative, the pertinency of reference, the credibility of citation or
example, the discursiveness of the narrative, and the way in which the
writer develops and finally presents the central thought or idea. All
these and other features of the written document are evidences to which
he gives great weight. “Up from Insanity” is neither sequential in
thought nor in narrative. Nearly every paragraph furnishes evidence of
the distractibility of the writer's mind, and the discursiveness of the
entire article amounts almost to rambling. It is marked with journalese
jargon which reminds me of the newspaper accounts of the kidnapping or
spiriting from Cuba of Señorita Cisneros.

The pith of the human document that we are discussing is that “every
man's strength wells up from some centre deeper in him than the brain.”
It does. A man's personality at any moment is the sum total of all
the reactions of every cell or physiological unit in his body; but
acceptance of this fact does not alter the universally accepted belief
that the brain is the organ of mind. To have it said by a psychopathic
individual that his restoration to a normal mental state came after
he had observed “that a double nerve centre at the base of the spine
had been aroused and the function of these centres brought balance and
poise and strength, which was instantly reflected in every movement
and thought, and that these basic nerve centres are the centre of the
will,” neither proves that there is such a centre nor makes it at all
probable that it exists.

Why such humanistic and scientific puerilities as these should have
been taken seriously is not easy to understand.

Our knowledge concerning the human mind is not by any means complete
or satisfactory, but there are certain things about it which we know.
For instance, we know that there is a conscious mind and a subconscious
mind. The discovery in 1866 of the “subliminal consciousness” of the
psychologist (the “unconscious mind” of the psychoanalyst), was called
by William James the greatest discovery in modern psychology. We know
that the person the individual thinks he is is the equivalent of his
conscious mind. The man that he really is is the man his unconscious
mind makes him. The face that he sees when he looks in the glass is the
face that goes with his conscious mind. The face that others see is
the one that fits his unconscious mind. Anyone who would observe the
revelations of that unconscious mind in literature can readily gratify
his wish by reading the “Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” that
remarkable presentation by James Joyce.

Many believe today that a man's ego or individuality is the equivalent
of this unconscious mind; that therein lies the power of genius,
the source of vision, the springs of inspiration that gush forth in
prophecy, in artistic creation, in invention.

We are now engaged in investigating this subliminal consciousness,
or unconscious mind, with every means at our disposal, and year by
year we are making headway. Our progress is not adequate, perhaps,
to satisfy the impatient and the impulsive, but with each succeeding
decade there is a distinct achievement. Nevertheless, in the
half-century during which we have been working at the matter in a
methodical--perhaps one might almost say a scientific--way, we have
discovered things about the mind which are truly epoch-making.

It is evident that the writer of the article, “Up from Insanity,”
has never been insane. He is a psychopathic individual who has had
distressing episodes. At times these episodes have parallelled with
considerable closeness the features of definite mental diseases such as
manic depressive insanity, at other times they seem to have resembled
the features of dementia præcox; but he never was the victim of either
one. He inherited an unstable nervous system which displayed itself in
youth as a shut-in, markedly sensitive, anti-social personality. Like
the majority of individuals so burdened, he was subject to periods of
excitation, at which times he did things at top speed. Neurologists
call this a “hypo-manic state,” that is, a state that resembles mania
in miniature. Such states would be followed by periods of inadequacy,
of retardation of mental and physical activity, and of depression.

After a severe attack which he suffered when he was twenty-one, he
had what is called in polite circles a “nervous breakdown,” the chief
symptoms being abortive delusions of reference. He thought that certain
parts of his body had changed so materially that it was necessary to
hide them from the gaze of onlookers. It made him sick to look at his
own face. He had to wear coloured glasses in order that others might
not read his secret from his eyes, and his sense of relationship with
everything constituting the external world was disordered disagreeably.
Accompanying this there were a series of symptoms which constitute
“feeling badly,” and all the functions of the body that were concerned
with nutrition were disordered, so that he became weak and lost flesh.
Oftentimes his depression of spirits was so great that he convinced
himself he wanted to die, but he did not embrace a good opportunity to
accomplish this end when it was offered to him. In fact, he struggled
so valiantly with the run-away horse that he checked him and “slid from
his back ingloriously,” physically exhausted. It would be interesting
to know why sliding off the back of a horse who has run away and
whose frenzy has been subdued by the rider should be an inglorious
dismounting. Of course it might be more glorious to tame him to such
a degree that his master could stand upon his back and direct his
capriciousness with a glance or a silken cord, but surely there is
nothing inglorious about any kind of dismount from the back of a horse
who has been transformed from a gentle to a wild animal.

Nevertheless, the experience was a beneficial one. When he reviewed
his prowess he realised that he had imposed his will-power, mediated
by muscle, upon the animal, and it occurred to him, a victim of
aboulia like the majority of psychopathic individuals, that to impose
a similar will-power upon himself would be a salutary procedure. With
this discernment came other revelations. One was that he had always
been lacking in concentration and was easily distracted--psychopathic
hallmarks which can be effaced to a remarkable degree, in many
instances, by training. The first fruit of his labour in this direction
was the discovery that Dr. Cook had been understudying Ananias,
Munchausen, _et al._

In another part of his article he says, with consummate familiarity,
“You are from Missouri when it comes to asking you to accept new
thoughts.” He may be assured that one of his readers is not. New
thoughts are as acceptable to this reader as breath to his nostrils;
but he would claim citizenship in that State if asked to accept it as
an indication of perspicacity to have discovered that Dr. Cook was a
fake.

Despite the fact that the writer of the article had “developed the
sixth sense to a startling degree,” which assured him success as a
journalist, he was chafing under his impotencies when he met a former
medium who “had given up that life since her marriage.” Unlike the
celebrated specialist's wife, who was the most beautiful creature
he had ever seen up to the time he met his own wife, this one was
“the most insignificant little woman I ever saw.” Whether it was her
experience gained as a medium, or as the wife of a rich lumberman of
the Middle West, that prompted her to shy the alleged lunatic, fearing
he would bore her with a narrative of his troubles, or whether she
did not want to rake up her past, cannot be gathered from the meagre
narrative. However, he got from her this nugget of wisdom:

    “To be really successful you must get in touch with the great
    reservoir of experience.”

From “one of the country's greatest physicians,” the like of which are
his personal friends, he got a paraphrase of the Scripture:

    “Learn a lesson from the flowers of the field, be humble and
    modest, be natural and play a man's part.”

It was then that calm repose settled upon him, and his nervous energy
returned to the old channels and nourished him.

If Mr. E. J. had only appended a few of his dreams to his human
document, there would be very little difficulty in pointing out the
emotional repression that was at the bottom of all his mental symptoms.
That he conforms to a certain well-known type of psychic fixation
there is very little doubt. He has always been bereft, because he has
a feeling of being spiritually or mentally alone. He never learned to
be independent in mind, but always looked for an uncritical, soothing,
maternal sort of love from people who were not ready or willing to give
it. He has not changed materially. Now that his so-called recovery has
come, and being unable to find what he demands, he takes refuge in the
next best thing, and plays at obtaining it vicariously; he convinces
himself that he is going to devote himself to doing for others “all the
little kindnesses that life offers.”

The layman who would get some knowledge of insanity should avoid such
confessions as that of E. J. If he would make acquaintance with the
self-coddling of a neurotic individual who delights in self-analysis,
self-pity, and exaggeration of his symptoms, and who is a fairly
typical example of juvenile fixation, his purpose will be accomplished
by reading this and similar articles. There is, however, a safer and
more satisfactory way of securing such information, and that is by
reading the writings of Pierre Janet. There he will find the obsessed,
the hysteric, the aboulic, the neurasthenic individual discussed in
masterly fashion, and he will find the presentation unmixed with
mediæval mysticism and puerile platitudes, unflavoured with specious
“uplift” sentiment and psychological balderdash.

On the other hand, he may get real enlightenment from “The Jungle of
the Mind,” published recently in the same magazine, providing he closes
his eyes to the editorial comment and refuses to read the letter “of a
physician of reputation” which sets forth that “according to all our
text-book symptoms of dementia præcox she was surely that.”

The purpose of such editorial comment must be either to suggest that
the enigmatic dissolution of the mind to which Schule gave the name
“precocious dementia” may eventuate in recovery, or to show that
doctors make mistakes. If it is the former, it needs a lot of proof; if
the latter, none whatsoever. Though students of mental pathology know
little or nothing of the causes of the mental disorders of hereditarily
predisposed individuals who get wrecked on the cliffs of puberty, or of
the alterations and structure of the tissues that subserve the mind,
they know, as they know the temperaments of their better halves, the
display, the types, the paradigms of the disease. And the lady who has
recently contributed some notes on a disfranchisement from the state of
_non compos mentis_ to the _Atlantic Monthly_ with such subtle display
of proficiency in the literary art, may be assured that the doctors who
averred she had dementia præcox added one more error to a list already
countless. With the daring of one who hazards nothing by venturing an
opinion, I suggest that she merely made a journey into a wild country
from whose bourne nearly all travellers return. The country is called
“Manic-Depressive Insanity.”

A young woman of gentle birth develops, while earning her bread in
uplift work, “nervous prostration,” that coverer of a multitude of
ills. Her sister's home, to which she goes, brings neither coherence
nor tranquillity. In fact, she gathers confusion rapidly there, and
seeks to get surcease of it in oblivion. After three attempts at
suicide, she is sent to a sanitarium. Six months of that exhausts
her financial resources. This, with increasing incoherency and
fading actuality, necessitate transfer to a state hospital, and
there she remains three years, going through the stages of violence,
indifference, tranquillity, resignation, and finally the test of work
and recreation, culminating happily in probational discharge and
resumption of previous work.

This is the record of thousands in this country and in every civilised
country. The variety of insanity which she had (and it is the commonest
of all the insanities) nearly always terminates in recovery--that
is, from the single attack. There is, of course, the likelihood of
recurrence. How to avoid that is what we are keen to learn from mental
hygienists and from those taught by experience. If this disenfranchised
lady will tell us ten years hence what she has done to keep well and
how her orientation has differed from that of the ten years following
puberty, she will make a human document of value intellectually, not
emotionally, as this one is. Meanwhile, should she be disposed to do
something for future psychopaths, she may record the experiences
of her life from childhood to the period of full development, and
particularly of the decade following her fifth year. If she will do
this with the truthfulness of James Joyce, the chasteness of Dorothy
M. Richardson, and the fullness of Marie Bashkirtseff, it may be said
of her: “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected
praise.”

It may be literature to describe one's fellow inmates of a psychopathic
hospital, to portray their adult infantilisms, to delineate their
schizophrenias, to recount their organised imageries, but it does not
contribute an iota to our knowledge of insanity, how to prevent it, and
how to cure it.

We need intrepid souls who will bare their psychic breasts and will
tell us, without fear or shame, of their conventionalised and primitive
minds: how the edifice was constructed, the secrets of the architect,
and of the builder. If Dostoievsky had been insane, not epileptic, the
literature of psychiatry would today be vastly more comprehensive.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

                      A POPULAR PERSONAGE AT HOME

                            BY THOMAS HARDY


             “I live here: ‘Wessex’ is my name,
                 I am a dog known rather well:
             I guard the house; but how that came
                 To be my lot I cannot tell.

             “With a leap and a heart elate I go,
                 At the end of an hour’s expectancy,
             To take a walk of a mile or so,
                 With the folk who share the house with me.

             “Along the path amid the grass
                 I sniff, and find out rarest smells
             For rolling over as I pass
                 The open fields towards the dells.

             “No doubt I shall always cross this sill,
                 And turn the corner, and stand steady,
             Gazing back for my mistress till
                 She reaches where I have run already.

             “And that this meadow with its brook,
                 And bulrush, just as it appears
             As I plunge past with hasty look,
                 Will stay the same a thousand years.”

             Thus “Wessex.” Yet a dubious ray
                 At times informs his steadfast eye,
             Just for a trice, as though to say:
                 “Will these things, after all, go by?”

                           Thomas Henry Titt

[Illustration]

                                                     ADELAIDE PHILLPOTTS


In the South West of London stands a cathedral, which, from outside,
looks like a child’s castle of bricks. But when you go inside you see
nothing at first but a large emptiness—a ceiling somewhere up in the
clouds supported by huge marble columns. There is always a smell of
incense in the air, and there is a little painted figure before which,
night and day, burn three rows of candles. Sometimes, on Saints’ Days,
other rows of candles are lighted before other painted figures—St.
Andrew, St. Patrick, St. George—making centres of bright light in the
dimness of the great interior.

Near this cathedral are blocks of tenement buildings where families
dwell, one on top of the other, like books in a bookcase. These
buildings are full of children: boys and girls and babies.

On the top floor of one of these blocks lived Thomas Henry Titt, aged
twelve. Thomas Henry’s father kept a shop round the corner where you saw
sausages and onions frying in the window. His mother was dead. He had an
elder sister who mended his clothes and helped their father in the shop.
Thomas was known as Tom-Tit; and he looked rather like a bird, for he
had thin arms and legs, sharp little eyes, a crest of bright hair, and a
pointed nose.

Like every imaginative child, Tom-Tit had a secret: a passion for the
sea, which he had never seen. His ocean was in his mind’s eye, and he
hoped as no one ever hoped before that one day he might behold the
reality of his dream. In the darkness of night Tom-Tit, alone in his
attic, lying awake on his mattress, gazed out upon a heaving
cornflower-blue coloured ocean—as blue as the flowers which the woman
sold at the end of his street. And this ocean was full of shining
fishes. There was no land in sight—ever.

Thomas Henry Titt loved the candles that burned before the painted
figure in the cathedral. In the winter, when he was small, he had often
held his little frozen hands to the warmth of them, when nobody was
looking. But as he grew older the candles began to have for him a deeper
significance. During evening service he would creep into a corner by one
of the pillars, listening to the organ and watching the kneeling people
in the distance near the shining altar. Then, when the music stopped and
the people were gone, he would steal out and patter along to the rows of
candles. There his heart would light up, even as they, and he would
thrill with a strange, unaccountable happiness.

Gradually Tom-Tit began to connect these candles with his desire for the
sea. The two facts became one in his mind. It was as if, by the light of
the former, he could see the blue waves of the other.

Underneath the rows of burning candles was a rack full of new ones. Tom
often saw people drop a coin into a box, take one, fix it upon a spike
among the rest, and light it. And a longing overcame him to possess for
his own one of these new candles. Perhaps, at the bottom of his mind,
was the idea that if he took it home and lighted it, it would bring him
nearer to his ultimate ambition—to see the sea. He determined to realise
his desire.

Then came a winter day when Tom-Tit’s head ached, shivers ran up and
down his spine, and he felt very ill. Therefore his sister bade him stay
in bed, and he did so until she had left the house with her father. But
then, despite his fever, the craving to possess that candle overcame
obedience. So, gripping a penny, he rose, staggered downstairs, and out
into the road. The cold air cooled his body and numbed his pains. He
slipped unnoticed into the cathedral and leaned for a moment against the
wall, for his head was swimming and he could not see. Then he recovered,
and his eyes sparkled as he beheld the candles flickering like golden
flowers before the wooden figure at the end of the aisle. The
surrounding air was a golden haze. The smell of incense was sweet.

He tottered to the box of new candles, dropped in his penny, and took
one. Then he dragged himself home, feeling worse and worse at every
step, but gloriously glad within, because of the candle in his pocket.

All day he lay on his bed, too ill to sit up, nursing his treasure. “I
shall be well to-night,” he thought, “and when it’s dark I’ll light it.”

In the evening his father and sister returned, found him in a state of
high fever, and sent for the doctor. He, when he saw Tom-Tit, said that
he would come back in the morning and remove him to the hospital if he
were not better.

He gave Tom a sleeping draught before he left.

When his father and sister had gone to bed, Thomas Henry, feeling drowsy
and less hurt with pain, pulled out his candle half melted already by
the heat of his hands, lit it, and set it on a chair by his side. Then
he lay gazing at it, until the whole world was but a golden flame with a
blue root.

Then a wonderful thing happened. He did not see the candle any more. His
first idea was that the wind must have blown it out, for a great wind
was blowing. Where could he be? He opened his eyes, which must have been
closed, and lo! he was in a little wooden boat on a cornflower-blue sea!
The boat was rocking from side to side like the baby’s cradle on the
floor below—a mechanical rock, rock, rock, rock, from side to side. He
scooped up a handful of the sea, and, just as he had expected, it was
bright blue. He could see blue shining fishes swimming round the boat,
so he caught them in his fingers where they wriggled about and made blue
reflections until he threw them back again into the blue water.

And all the time, though he could not see it, the candle was burning at
his side—burning lower, and lower, and lower.

From horizon to horizon the cobalt ocean stretched around him—not a
speck of land anywhere. He was perfectly happy there staring down
through the blue fathoms and feeling the wind blow. He had never been so
happy in his life before.

Then the candle went out.

In the morning they found a little pool of grease on the chair—and
Tom-Tit was dead.

But this is not really a sad story, because Thomas Henry did what many
thousands of people never do, even though they live to be a hundred and
three—he realised his ambition. He saw the sea. And he was not
disillusioned; for the sea that he saw was just as beautiful as the sea
which he imagined: the reality matched the dream.

                                                         HERBERT ASQUITH


                When lights are out and Pat’s in bed,
                He tells a story from his head
                Of men who fight by sea and land
                With cutlasses in either hand.
                Who make their mouths into a sheath
                And sharpen dirks upon their teeth;
                And schooners heeling to the breeze
                That blows across the coral seas,
                With kegs of rum and bars of gold
                And corpses rolling in the hold.
                Then far below the dining-room
                Pours out its voices: through the gloom
                Borne on tobacco-laden air
                The roar of talk comes up the stair,
                But where are now the coral seas
                And where is Pat? Lost on the breeze
                With streaming flag the schooner fades
                And takes her captain to the shades.




                        Invitation to the Voyage

                           (_A New Version_)

                                                            ALFRED NOYES


              A rambling cherry-petalled stream;
                A bridge of pale bamboo;
              A path that seemed a twisted dream
                Where everything came true;
              A crimson-lanterned garden-house
              With jutting eaves below the boughs;
                The slant-eyed elves in blue
              With soft slip-slapping heels and toes
              Dancing before the Daimyōs:

              “_And is it Old Japan_,” you cry
                “That half-remembered place”—
              I see beneath an English sky
                A child with brooding face.
              The curious realm he chose to build
              And paint with any hues he willed
                Is all I strive to trace,
              Where odds and ends of memory smile
              Like bits of heaven, through clouds awhile.

              And some for charts and maps would call,
                But here, beside the fire,
              The kakemono on the wall
                Is all that we require.
              A chanty piped by bosun Lear
              May float around us while we steer
                Our hearts to their desire—
              The Nonsense Land beyond the sun
              Where West and East, at last, are one.

              Then let the rigging hum the tales
                That Tusitala[1] told
              When first we spread our purple sails
                In quest of pirate gold;
              For, though he waved us all good-bye
              Beneath the deep Samoan sky,
                His heart was blithe and bold,
              And hailed across a darker main
              The shadowy hills of home again.

              So we, who now adventure far
                Beyond the singing foam,
              May see, in every dipping star,
                The harbour lights of home;
              And, finding still, as all have found,
              That every ship is homeward bound,
                (For none could ever roam
              A sea too wide for heaven to span)
              Sail on—sail on—to Old Japan.

                          I Wish I Were a Dog

                                                       DESMOND MACCARTHY


There were five in the family and Dicky, nearly nine, was the youngest
but one. Dicky’s father was a country doctor, and, like many country
doctors, he led rather a hard life. The sick people he visited lived
miles apart, and many were too poor to pay him properly.

Dr. Brook was a tall, pale man with grizzled hair turning to grey. He
was clever, and he had a quick, short way of talking. He seemed to make
up his mind about everything in a moment, and if you asked him a
question, he answered as though it ought not to have been necessary to
explain.

Dicky would have been surprised to hear that his father was a kind man,
but kind he was. He hated attending upon well-to-do people who had
nothing much the matter with them, though he knew he must visit them to
make enough money to bring up his own children properly.

He would remember this while he was driving miles out of his way to see
some poor cottager, and so, when he arrived at the cottage, he was
usually in a bad temper. On the other hand, when he was calling on old
Mrs. Varden at The Grange, who was sound as a bell and would probably
live to be ninety, he was always thinking of those who really wanted
looking after. Then, instead of smiling sympathetically, while she told
him how queer she had felt in the middle of the night three weeks ago,
or how well her nephews were doing, he would stand in front of the fire
in her cosy sitting-room, look up at the ceiling with a stern
expression, and rattle the keys in his pocket in a manner which said
plainly, “How much longer shall I have to listen to this stuff?” So,
although everybody thought Dr. Brook “a very clever doctor,” few people
were fond of him.

All day he went bumping and rushing along the country lanes and roads in
his shabby, muddy car, which he never had time to clean properly; and
when he got home his day’s work was not over. In the evening he turned
schoolmaster and taught his children.

Dicky’s mother had died when his brother Peregrin was born. Ella, the
eldest of the children, a grown-up girl, kept house and taught Dicky and
Peregrin in the morning. She was very like her father in many ways, only
her cleverness had turned to music. She played the violin beautifully,
and she was dying to get away from home and become a famous musician.
Dr. Brook knew this and was very sorry for her; but he could not let her
go till Dicky and Peregrin went to school. She had to be a governess
till then. The other two boys had done very well. They had both got
scholarships, and little Peregrin was as sharp as a needle.

Altogether the doctor had to admit he was very blessed in his children.
But there was Dicky! Dicky was a dunce, there was no doubt about it—at
least, so Ella reported. And when Dicky showed his smudgy exercise-books
to his father in the evenings, his father thought it only too true.

Dicky dreaded the evening every day. He did not much mind his sister
Ella’s crossness. He was used to it. But there was something awful about
the weary quiet way his father used to ask, “Do you understand _now_?”
Dicky had then to say “Yes,” and presently his father would find out he
hadn’t understood at all. There would be a still longer pause, and at
last his father would sigh, “Unhappy boy, what will become of you!”

This was far worse than being slapped by Ella, though her ring sometimes
really did hurt. His father would then repeat what he had said before,
twice, very slowly, as though he were dropping the words drop by drop
into a medicine glass, looking at Dicky all the time, till Dicky’s lips
began to quiver and his eyes to fill, when his father would say hastily,
pulling out his watch, “There, there. It’s time for bed. Run along. Kiss
me.” Then Dicky’s one desire was to get out of the room before bursting
into tears. He did not mind if it happened outside the door or upstairs.
Indeed, it was rather a comfort to cry, especially if he could only get
hold of Jasper, the black spaniel, to hug and talk to while he was
crying. But he was terrified at breaking down before his father. He
somehow felt if he did, he might never stop sobbing, or that something
else dreadful would happen. One evening it did happen.

The day had been altogether a bad day. Dicky had got up that morning
feeling as if his head was rather smaller and lighter than usual. It
felt about the size of an apple. Ella had had a fat letter that morning
from her bosom friend, at the Royal College of Music in London. Lessons
were always worse on the days she heard from her, and that morning it
was true also, for once in a way, that Dicky had really _not_ been
“trying.” He had begun by making thirty-four mistakes in his French
dictation—and he was rather glad. During arithmetic he had amused
himself by imagining that the numbers had different characters, and that
some of them were very pleased to find themselves side by side in the
sums. The result was that all his sums were wrong, and he had
exasperated Ella by telling her that it was the fault of number 8, who
was a quarrelsome widow and wore spectacles.

When left alone to do his Latin Prose, while Ella went to her bedroom to
practise furiously on the fiddle, he had spent the time in teasing a
beetle by hemming it in between canals of ink on the schoolroom table.
He liked the beetle, but he enjoyed imagining its disgust and
perplexity, and he enjoyed feeling that he could, but wouldn’t, drown
it. When Ella came back and found that he had only written one Latin
word, “Jam” (already), on the paper, she tore the exercise book from him
and said that he could do what he liked: she would tell his father and
never teach him again—never, never, never.

[Illustration: “SHE WOULD NEVER TEACH HIM AGAIN—NEVER, NEVER”]

But the evening was a long way off, and Dicky walked into the garden, in
a gloomy sort of way rather proud of himself. He found, however, he
could not amuse himself, so he devoted himself to amusing Jasper,
chasing him in circles about the lawn and throwing sticks for him to
fetch. When the dog had had enough, and lay down on the grass with his
paws out in front of him like a lion, Dicky did not know what to do
next. He went down himself on all fours and kissed Jasper, who
responded, between quick pants, with a hasty slobber of his pink
quivering tongue, as though he were snapping at a fly. Ah, if only he
were as happy as Jasper! Dicky suddenly remembered that an old gentleman
had once given him a sort of blessing, saying, “May you be as happy as a
good dog.” What an easy time Jasper had! Of course he got into trouble
if he rolled in things, but if Dicky were in his shoes—or perhaps he
ought to say on his paws—_he_ wouldn’t want to. (Jasper certainly had a
very odd taste in scent.) Examinations, scholarships—those awful things
meant nothing to him. Dicky thought he could have easily managed to be a
good dog. And since he wanted to stop thinking about himself, he began
to play a favourite game of imagining what Jasper said to other dogs
about his home and the family. How he would boast to them of the
excellent rabbit-hunting in the copse near by, of the good bones he had
and the warm fires; and how he would tell them about jumping on Dick’s
bed in the morning and how perfectly Dick and he understood each other.
But the worst of it was that unless one were tired and a little sleepy,
one could not go on with that game very long. It soon began to seem
silly. It was not a good morning game.

Ella was very grim at lunch and only spoke to Peregrin. After luncheon
Dicky felt very inclined to work—anything to stop thinking. He said
something about learning grammar, but Ella took all the books away and
locked them up. She said he could do _whatever he liked_. This had never
happened before and it frightened him.

He went for a walk by himself. The sky was grey and the hedges were
dripping and his feet felt heavy. He actually tried to remember what
cases the different prepositions governed in Latin, as he walked along,
in the hope of surprising his father in the evening; but the fear that
he might be repeating them to himself all wrong made him hopeless. It
was never safe to learn without the book. Only once, when a red stoat
ambled with arched back across the lane, did he forget himself. A stoat,
too, must have a jolly life, he thought, even if it ended by being
nailed up on a door by a keeper. He stayed out till it was dark and past
tea time.

His father’s hat and coat were not in the hall when he returned, so
Dicky knew he had not yet come back. Upstairs he could hear the wailing
of Ella’s violin. He went up and knocked at her door. She did not say
“Come in,” or stop bowing away or frowning at the music on the stand in
front of her. “If you’re hungry get milk in the kitchen,” she said, her
chin still on the fiddle, “and—shut the door.”

Dicky did so, and stood for a minute outside it. Then he went slowly to
the schoolroom and sat down at the table. Peregrin was already in bed,
and there was nothing to do but to wait.

Time passed very slowly, and if Dicky had not known that he was dreading
something, he would have thought he must be ill. He did, indeed, feel
very queer. At last he heard the front door slam and the tramp of his
father’s stride in the hall. The same instant the sound of the violin
stopped and Ella walked rapidly along the passage; and before Dicky knew
what he was doing he had started to run after her. At the head of the
stairs he stopped himself, and peeping over the bannisters he saw that
his father had hesitated in the middle of pulling off his coat, and was
staring at Ella, who was talking vehemently in front of him. Dicky heard
her raised voice saying, “It is hopeless. Father, I won’t; I really
can’t. He....” His father finished getting out of his coat without a
word; then they both went into the study. The door closed behind them,
and Dicky crept back to the schoolroom.

Presently, he heard Ella calling him to come down. A few minutes before,
his legs had carried him to the top of the stairs without his wanting
it, now they refused to move. “Father wants you in the study at once,”
she shouted, and she continued to call, “Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick.” There
was a long pause and Ella herself stood in the doorway.

“Father is coming to whip you,” she said, and walked off to her room.

But he did not come. Dicky waited with beating heart, but he did not
come. He waited till he almost forgot he was waiting, and yet his father
did not come. And when at last he heard soft shuffling steps coming
along the passage, his heart almost stopped. To his astonishment he saw
in the darkness beyond the door two small round orange lamps shining
about a foot from the ground. It was only Jasper, who padded quietly
into the room and lay down on the hearthrug with a quiet sigh of
satisfaction. Having settled himself in the shape of a large foot-stool,
Jasper did not lift his nose again, but he turned up his eyes at
Dicky—they were brown eyes now, exquisitely humble and kind—and wagged
his stumpy tail. Dicky had flung himself on the floor beside the dog and
embraced him. Were these the terrible sobs which would never leave off?
No, presently they did stop; and gradually Dicky even forgot that he was
waiting for something awful. The occasional dab of the dog’s cold nose
on his hot cheeks was comforting, and so it was to curl all round him.
Dicky felt almost as though he were a dog himself when he was curled up
like that.

“Do you know, Jasper, if I were a dog, I should be a very clever dog?
Much, much cleverer than you,” he whispered with his face buried in the
black fur. His head felt swollen and confused. “A re-markable dog,” he
repeated, “I should be a very re-markable dog.”

Downstairs Dr. Brook was sitting close up to the fire and staring
gloomily into it. He had forgotten that he held a short switch in his
hand, and that it still hung down between his knees. He was thinking in
pictures and the pictures were not of Dicky. He had forgotten Dicky; he
had even forgotten himself. They say the whole of life passes before a
drowning man’s eyes. The doctor ever since he sat down had felt like a
man drowning in a sea of troubles. If not the whole of his own life,
still, much of it, had passed before his eyes. Only when at last he was
eating his cold solitary dinner in the dining-room, did he remember
again that Dicky had been naughty that morning, and that Dicky was
probably incurably stupid. But even if he were it did not seem now to
matter much, or to matter in a different way. Ella, too, he thought,
must go to her College of Music; things could somehow be managed. The
doctor sat a very long time over his dinner.

But upstairs still stranger things were happening to Dick. First he felt
hot and large, then cold and small. He kept on shivering. Was this silky
hair his own or Jasper’s? And where was he? He was apparently in a wet,
grey place. What he touched with his hands and feet felt rough and
gritty. Suddenly he saw a brown stoat with an arched back ambling
rapidly in front of him—it was as big as a fox. Yes, he was on a
road—the very road he had walked along that very afternoon, only now the
wet hedges were ever so much higher. And before Dicky knew what he was
doing he was dashing after the stoat, right into the quickset hedge
after it. What was he doing? He smelt a queer strong smell which excited
him; and he pushed and struggled through the roots and thorns, following
the smell. He seemed, too, to be wearing a very odd cap with long flaps,
which kept catching in the brambles and dragging him back. This did not
hurt, but it was a nuisance, and he had constantly to shake his head. He
traced the smell of stoat to a rabbit hole and thrust his head down it.
Hullo! Dicky had no idea rabbits smelt so deliciously, as nice as
pineapples or peaches! Dicky had wanted to kill the stoat, but he would
have liked to eat the rabbit. He tried to make the hole larger, by
tearing away the earth with his hands, but, although he got on much
faster than he expected, he soon saw that was no use; and dragging
himself violently backwards out of the hedge, he found himself in the
road again with nothing to do.

Yes, there was nothing, absolutely nothing to do. The sensation was a
strange one, for he couldn’t even think of anything. He just stood there
snuffing the wet wind. Then suddenly he found himself trotting towards
home. He had not gone very far when he was aware of another smell which
he somehow recognised instantly as “The Sacred Smell.” He knew what it
was, though he had never smelt it properly before. It reminded him of a
feeling he had sometimes had in church—how long ago that seemed!—and
partly of a feeling he had had when once an old general in scarlet and
covered with medals had patted him on the head. Only this time The
Sacred Smell was mixed with other smells; with smells of horse, leather,
onions and smoke. This, Dicky knew, was not as it should be, and he was
distinctly alarmed. However, he thought he had better stand still. It
was always better, something whispered to him, not to run away from The
Sacred Smell—unless the danger was terrific.

Of course, having smelt The Sacred Smell, he was not at all surprised to
see next a huge pair of muddy boots coming towards him, and a pair of
huge knees in dirty trousers moving up and down. When they were a short
distance off, they stopped; and Dicky, looking up, saw what he had
expected; an unshaven, dark-skinned Man in a cap, with a spotted
handkerchief knotted round his neck. The Man made a squeaking noise with
his pursed-up lips, such as rats make, and slapped his thigh once or
twice. Dicky knew what this meant, but even when the Man called in a
croaking voice, “E-e-e-’ere good boy,” Dicky still thought it was best
not to move. He stood and turned his face instead to the hedge, looking,
no doubt, as absent-minded and miserable as he felt. (It was odd, but
_now_ when Dicky felt wretched and miserable that feeling was strongest,
not just under the middle of his ribs, but at the end of his spine where
his legs began; there now was the seat of anguish.) The Man took a step
or two nearer, then another step. Still Dicky did not stir. Suddenly the
Man dashed forward and made a grab at him. Dicky ducked, started aside
and bumped right into the road-bank. He saw the Man’s hand outstretched
above him, and he knew there was now only one thing to do: to roll right
over on to his back, in order to show he wouldn’t resist and hoped for
mercy. The Man stroked Dicky’s head and made soothing noises; and then,
suddenly, put an arm under him, lifting him up and holding him tight to
his side.

[Illustration: “THE MAN DASHED FORWARD AND MADE A GRAB AT HIM”]

Dicky felt perfectly miserable, but what could he do? He knew it would
be folly to try to escape, and that it would be wiser to wait for an
opportunity. The Man tucked him with a jerk still more firmly under his
arm, and started to walk slowly on. He walked on for more than an hour,
till they came to a gorse common, where a caravan was standing with
empty shafts and a pair of steps behind. Gripping Dicky tighter than
ever the Man gave a whistle, and a Woman came out of the caravan.

“Where did you find him, Joe?” said the Woman, looking at Dicky.

“’Long road,” said the Man, jerking his head backwards.

“You ain’t been and thrown away his collar, ’ave you, Joe?”

“’Adn’t any,” said the Man. Dicky was very dazed, but he did think they
were talking about him in an odd way.

“Better take ’im where he belongs,” said the Woman. “The cops won’t
believe as such as ’e is ours. He looks well cared for. Might get five
bob.”

Dicky did not try to tell them where he lived; he felt somehow it would
be no use to try.

Instead of answering the Man just threw him into the caravan and shut
the door. Although it was nearly dark, Dicky found he could see
surprisingly well. Presently a tin bowl full of scraps of meat and bones
was thrust in. Dicky would have been revolted by such a mess a short
time ago, but now, though he was too scared to feel hungry, he could not
resist putting his face close to it and giving a sniff. It really smelt
uncommonly good. He put out the tip of his tongue and touched a
brown-looking, ragged bit of gristle. Yes, it was good. Then all of a
sudden he understood what must have happened. He had changed into a dog!
Into a black spaniel!

He dashed at the door, shouting at the top of his voice, “Let me out!
Let me out!” Alas, the only word which sounded at all like what he
wanted to say was, “Out.” “Out, out, out, out,” he kept barking, hoping
that the Man and Woman would understand. They took no notice; but he
could not stop. “Out, out, out,” he barked. He shook the door by jumping
at it; he tore at the wood with his nails. There was a latch just within
his reach when he sprang up, but his paws—yes, it was only too true, his
hands were round, black and feathery—could not lift it. “Out, out, out.”
No answer. At last he gave it up, and lay down on the floor, feeling
very tired. It occurred to him presently that he might think better
while gnawing a bone. So he went to the bowl and pulled out the largest.
It was a slight comfort to him. With his head on one side and his teeth
sliding along the bone, he found he could think a little more calmly.
How was he to let them know that he was not a real dog, but a boy called
Dicky Brook? He tried again to talk. After a lot of practice he
succeeded in making a sound rather like “Brrr-ook,” but it was also too
sadly like the noise Jasper made when he was too lazy to bark or had
been told to stop barking. Dicky was afraid they would never understand.
But surely a very clever dog could make people understand somehow?

At last the door opened and the Man appeared, black against the starry
sky. He stumbled over Dicky, swore and lit a stinking lamp-flame the
size of the blade of a pocket knife. He was followed by the Woman.
Outside Dicky could see the red glow of the fire which had cooked their
dinner. Now was his chance. What should he do to astonish them? That was
the first thing to do, to astonish them till they began to understand.
But all Dicky could think of was a doggy thing after all: he sat up and
begged. The Woman grinned at him, but the Man, who was pulling off his
great boots, flung one at him, which Dicky dodged. He at once sat up on
his hind-legs again, this time joining his paws and holding them up high
in front of him.

“Bli’my Joe, look at the dawg!” exclaimed the Woman. “It’s saying its
prayers!”

The Man, too, stared in astonishment.

“I don’t like it,” said the Woman.

Dicky felt greatly encouraged. At home he was fond of turning
somersaults. Now, down went his head and over went his hind-legs. It was
not a good somersault (he was too short in the legs for somersaults now)
but it was one. The Man gave a shout of laughter, and his face lit up
with joy and cunning.

“S’truth, it’s a performing dawg! I ain’t taking ’im back, no fear.
He’ll make our fortunes.”

At these words Dicky saw he had made a terrible mistake. If he was a
dog, he had better not be a re-markable dog.

[Illustration: “HE COULD NOT FALL ANY FURTHER”]

The door was still open, and through it he dashed, taking the steps at a
leap. Now he was falling, falling, falling. What a height! Oh, would he
never reach the bottom? Stars were flying above him like bees. The awful
thing was that he was beginning to fall slowly, while a huge arm with a
hand at the end of it was stretching out, longer and longer, after him.
He was not even falling slowly now; he was floating. He tried to force
himself down through the air, but though there was nothing to keep him
up he could not fall any further. Suddenly the arm gripped him. In an
agony of terror he yelled: “I’m not a dog.” He heard his own voice, and,
to his amazement, he saw his father’s face close to his; it was his
father’s arm lifting him from the hearthrug. He felt a hand cool on his
forehead. “Dick, you’re feverish. My little Dick.” His father’s voice
had never sounded like that before, and he felt himself being
carried—deliciously safe—to bed.

“After all,” he said to himself, as he snuggled down, “I’m glad I’m not
a dog.”

                            THE SHADOW LAND

                                                             DAVID CECIL


             Night falls upon a day of storm,
                 Of mist and gust and rain,
             And still wind howls along the sands,
             And sleet with myriad tiny hands,
                 Slaps at the window pane.

             Awake in bed lay Jack and Jane,
                 They watched the shadows play;
             Their eyes roved round from wall to floor
             And then they stopped and roved no more.
             A lady standing by the door
                 Looked at them as they lay.

             Her skin was smooth as ivory,
                 Her hair was like pale silk
             All spells and secrets seemed to lie
             Beneath each slanting emerald eye,
                 And eyelid white as milk.

             Her stiff skirts gleamed in the firelight
                 And the ceaseless hurrying shadows.
             Her voice was high and far away
             Like distant voice at close of day,
                 Calling across the meadows.

             “Come!” she said, “Come!”; the children came,
                 They had nor voice nor will.
             Round her the hurrying shadows skim,
             She struck one with her knuckles slim,
                 It fluttered and stood still.

[Illustration: WILDER YET THE SHADOWS WHIRL]


              Wilder yet the shadows whirl.
                  As nailed to wall and floor,
              Stood firm this one; she whispered “Follow.”
              Then swiftly swooping like a swallow,
                  Slipt through as through a door.

              And she led them to far shadowland,
                  Where the shadows stand upright;
              And walk and talk, while on the ground,
              The live men trail without a sound,
                  Solid and pink and white.

              Where the echo is heard before the song,
                  And in the pools you see
              Reflected houses steady stand,
              While real ones built upon the land
                  Tremble continually.

              All night long stayed Jack and Jane,
                  But when the dawn grew red,
              They crept back through the shadow door,
              Across the firelight-chequered floor,
                And scrambled back to bed.

                            THE BARGAIN SHOP

                                                     BY CYNTHIA ASQUITH.


                                   I

Once upon a time there lived a man called Anselm, who used several times
an hour to stamp his foot and cry out: “I _must_ be rich! I _must_ be
rich!” He was married to the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and,
since he had enough to eat and a weatherproof house, and had neither
aches nor pains, he should have been happy for 365 days in each year.
But his unceasing longing for great wealth spoilt everything, and even
on fine days he went about looking as discontented as though he were
hungry.

As for his wife, Jasmine, she had long red-gold hair and great green
eyes set wide apart in her flower-like face, and she possessed a mirror
in which she could see her shimmering loveliness. So she ought to have
been very happy and very grateful. She was so beautiful that when she
walked abroad, men would lean far out of their windows to watch her pass
and then wonder why their own wives and daughters should look so much
like suet puddings.

But, though you will scarcely believe it, Jasmine was quite as
discontented as her husband, and pouted and sighed through the days.

For she, too, was consumed by this perpetual craving for riches. Whether
she had caught this uncomfortable sort of illness from her husband, or
whether she had given it to him, I do not know, but there they were both
wasting their youth, their beauty, and their love for one another, in
foolish, petulant longing.

Whenever Jasmine saw other women clad in rich raiment and adorned with
jewels, envy would blight her loveliness as frost blights a flower.

“Of what use is my beauty if I cannot adorn it?” she cried. “I _must_
have pearls—ropes of pearls, crowns of glittering diamonds, emeralds,
rubies, and sapphires!”

“Yes,” said Anselm, “and I must have a hundred horses, a thousand
slaves, and fountains that spout forth wines!”

One day, as Jasmine walked sadly through a deep, dark forest she
suddenly saw a very strange looking house moving slowly towards her. The
roof of the house was most beautifully thatched with brightly-coloured
feathers, and across its face in rainbow letters ran the queer
inscription:

                           THE BARGAIN HOUSE

                  MONEY FOR SALE.      ENQUIRE WITHIN.

“Money for sale?” read the wondering Jasmine. “What can this mean? Some
foolish jest, no doubt.”

Three times the house sped round her; then it quivered and stood still.
She stared at the glass door that held a myriad reflections of herself.
As though her gaze had power to push, it slowly opened. She now saw into
a vast hall, and heard a gentle but compelling voice say: “Come in.”
Trembling, Jasmine walked through the door. The light was dim and
flickering as though from a fire, but no fireplace could be seen. Across
the whole length of the hall ran a counter, such as you see in large
shops, and behind this counter there rose up a wall made of rows of
boxes piled high the one upon the other, and on these boxes were rainbow
letters and figures. Between the boxes and the counter there stood a
tall, sweetly-smiling woman, whose face, though unrecognisable, seemed
somehow familiar to Jasmine.

“I was expecting you, beautiful Jasmine,” spoke the stranger in a voice
that was soft but decided, like the fall of snow. “You would buy money,
would you not?”

“Can one buy money?” faltered Jasmine. “Save _with_ money, and, alas! I
have none.”

“Though you were penniless, yet from me you could purchase boundless
wealth,” replied the stranger. “Behold, a purse,” she continued, holding
up a red-tasselled bag, “which, spend as you may, will always contain
one thousand golden guineas. This purse is yours if in exchange you will
give me one part of yourself.”

“A part of myself?” gasped the astonished Jasmine. “What would you have?
My hair?”

“No,” smiled the woman. “Lovely as are your tresses, in time they would
grow again, and no one may own unlimited wealth and pay no price
therefor. Your beauty shall remain untouched. It is your Sense of Humour
that I require.”

“My Sense of Humour?” laughed Jasmine. “Is that all? Just that part of
me which makes me laugh? Humour? What was it my mother used to call
Humour? I remember—she said it was Man’s consolation sent to him by God
in sign of peace. God’s rainbow in our minds. But with boundless wealth
what need of consolation shall I have? Besides, I have often been told I
had but little Sense of Humour. The more gladly will I give it to you.
The purse, I pray,” and Jasmine held out both her trembling hands.

“Stay a while,” said the solemn, smiling woman. “I must warn you of two
conditions. First, I would have you know, the money this purse yields
can be spent only upon yourself. Would you still have it?”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” clamoured Jasmine.

“I must also tell you that should you ever repent of your bargain and
wish to buy back the precious sense you sell, it will, alas, not be in
my power to help you. I can never buy back from the person to whom I
have sold. The only chance of recovering your Sense of Humour is, that
another customer, unasked by you, should buy it back with a similar
purse, and I warn you that it may be hard to find anyone willing to give
up boundless wealth for the sake of your laughter.”

“What matter?” exclaimed Jasmine. “Never, never shall I wish to return
my purse.”

“You are determined?” asked the strange saleswoman.

“Yes, yes, yes!”

“Hold out your arms, then.”

Eagerly Jasmine stretched out her arms.

The smiling woman touched her on both her funny-bones, drew forth her
Sense of Humour, laid it away in a box, on which she wrote Jasmine’s
name, and the date, and then placed it on a shelf between two other
boxes.

“Now it is mine, until redeemed by the return of a purse, fellow to this
that I give thee,” said the woman, handing the tasselled red bag to
Jasmine. “And while it is in my careful keeping, this despised sense of
yours will grow and grow. Farewell, Jasmine. Leave me now and go forth
into a bleak world.”

Clasping the marvellous purse to her heart, Jasmine fled from the house
and hastened through the deep, dark forest till she reached the city. At
once she went to the great jewel-merchants, against whose windows she
had often pressed her face in wistful longing.

“I want the biggest pearl necklace you have got,” she cried,
breathlessly bursting into the gorgeous showroom.

“I’m afraid goods of such value can only be supplied in exchange for
ready money,” said the merchant with an uncivil smile.

“How much?” asked Jasmine.

[Illustration]

“Seven thousand guineas.”

Jasmine opened the purse and holding it upside down, shook it.
Glittering guineas poured out in a golden stream, but the purse remained
just as full as before.

As the clinking coins bounded and rolled the merchant’s eyes grew
rounder and rounder, and he had to shout for six small black slaves to
come to help him to count the money, now lying scattered all over his
shop. With the lowest bow he had ever bowed he handed the long rope of
glistening pearls to Jasmine. Feverishly she clasped them round her
throat, where they scarcely showed against the whiteness of her skin.
They reached down to her knees.

“Now some emerald ear-rings, a crown of diamonds, ten ruby bracelets for
each arm, and all the opals you possess!” ordered Jasmine, scattering
guineas as she spoke, and putting on all the jewels as fast as they were
produced.

At last she went away, hung with jewels as a Christmas tree is hung with
ornaments. Proud as a peacock she strutted through the streets, and
everyone laughed at the absurd sight of so many gaudy ornaments crowded
on to one ordinary-sized woman. She heard titters and wondered what
might be the cause of the laughter.

She now went to the grandest Fashion House in the city, ordered one
thousand costly garments, and came out wearing the richest raiment she
had found in stock. Next she bought a most magnificent coach, made of
mother o’ pearl, and sixteen piebald horses to draw it; and then she
engaged an enormous coachman with a face gilt to match his golden
livery.

On her way home she stopped at seven merchants to buy all manner of rare
and costly foods, and before long the great coach was crammed with
dainties. In it were piled every fruit and vegetable that happened to be
then out of season, bottles of wonderful wine, jars of caviare, pots of
roseleaf jam, tiny birds in aspic, and sugar plums of every colour. Last
of all—because it looked so grand and expensive—she bought an immense
wedding-cake, sixteen stories high. The confectioners laughed. They
seemed to think it funny that she should buy the wedding-cake. She
wondered why they were amused.

When Anselm saw his wife stagger into the room, swaying beneath the
weight of so many gaudy jewels, thinking them to be all sham and worn in
jest, he burst into a great roar of laughter.

Annoyed at his merriment, Jasmine told him breathlessly of the
marvellous purse. Her husband laughed and laughed, partly at her story,
partly at her absurd appearance. He laughed until he got hiccoughs.

“Oh, how funny! How funny! What has come over you?” he cried, rolling on
the floor.

“This is no jest, Anselm, I swear; it is the solemn truth. Just look
inside and you will see all the golden coins.”

Incredulously Anselm peered into the bulging purse. He rubbed his eyes.
Slowly his unbelief gave way to amazed joy.

“Praise be to God!” he cried at last. “We’re rich, rich, rich beyond the
dreams of man. Give it to me that I may go and buy gorgeous apparel,
fine horses, and rarest wines.” Feverishly he snatched the purse from
his wife’s hand.

“What’s this?” he cried. “I knew it was some trickery. Your precious
purse is as empty as an egg that has been eaten.” And in truth, the
tasselled bag now dangled from his hand flat and light as a leaf.

“Oh!” screamed Jasmine, in dismay, “give it back to me!” No sooner had
she touched the purse than once more it became rounded and heavy with
the weight of a thousand guineas.

“Praise be to God!” she sighed. “I remember now. The woman from whom I
bought it warned me that the guineas were only for my own use.”

“Tut, tut, that’s very troublesome,” said Anselm ruefully. “But what
matter? You will be able to buy gifts for me. It will come to the same
thing. But, wife, what mean you when you say you _bought_ the purse?
With what can one buy money?”

Jasmine told him of the weird house, the mysterious saleswoman and the
strange bargain she had driven.

“Your Sense of Humour?” cried Anselm. “_Your_ Sense of Humour! Well, she
didn’t get much for her money, did she? Ha! ha! ha!”

With grave eyes Jasmine stared at her husband, offended at his display
of merriment.

Then she said: “You little guess what a banquet I have prepared for you.
Come now and I will show you how I have ransacked the city for its
choicest dainties. Let us now feast.” Together they entered the
dining-hall and at sight of the gorgeous banquet spread before them
Anselm smacked his lips and promised himself great delight.

But bitter disappointment awaited him. For, no sooner did he touch the
iced grape-fruit with which he intended to begin his feast, than,
behold, it shrivelled in his hand, and became an empty rind. With an
oath he stretched out his hand to grasp a goblet of purple wine. It
broke in his hand, and of the rich vintage nothing remained but a stain
on the damask tablecloth.

“Alas!” cried Jasmine. “It seems that with the magic gold I may buy
nothing for your use!”

In truth, everything that poor Anselm touched, before it reached his
eager lips, disappeared like a bubble that has burst. In nothing that
had been purchased with the magic gold could he share. For him, all the
rich viands were spread in vain, and finally, he was obliged to fall
back on their accustomed fare of bread and cheese and last Friday’s
mutton.

“’Tis funny to watch one’s wife quaffing the wines one dreams of and to
be on prison-fare oneself,” laughed Anselm, trying to make the best of
things.

“Funny?” asked his wife. “Why is it funny? I think it is very sad. These
humming birds and this sparkling juice of the grape are most delicious.”

To keep up his spirits Anselm, who was famed for his wit, cracked many
jokes, but no smile ever lifted the corners of Jasmine’s perfect mouth;
no twinkle appeared in the depth of her great green eyes. Discouraged at
last, Anselm fell into silent sulks, whilst his wife continued to eat
and drink, until a stitch came in both her sides.

Days passed. Every evening, Jasmine, clad in new raiment and gorgeous
jewels, regaled herself with rich dainties.

“Alas, husband!” she cried one night, “I have no pleasure in feasting
that you cannot share.”

“In truth, this is no life!” angrily exclaimed Anselm. “To sit at a
banquet one may not taste with a wife who cannot see one’s jokes. I can
bear it no longer. Why should not I seek this strange woman and make the
same bargain? If husband and wife may not share their jokes, they must
at least share their dinner. Tell me quickly where I may find this
‘Bargain House.’”

Jasmine told her husband the way through the deep, dark forest, and
early the next morning he set forth in search of the mysterious
building. An hour’s walking brought him within sight of just such a
house as his wife had described. It moved nearer, sped three times
around him and then stood still. As he stared at it, the door slowly
opened, the gentle, commanding voice bade him enter, and there stood the
tall, smiling woman of his wife’s description.

“Good morning, Anselm,” she said, in the voice that was soft like the
fall of snow. “Would you have a purse that shall always bear a thousand
guineas?”

“Indeed I would!” cried Anselm. “Have you one for me?”

“Yes, if you consent to my terms.”

“What is it that you want? My Sense of Humour? Of what use is it to me
now? I will gladly part with it.”

“No,” said the woman. “’Tis not your Sense of Humour I require of you,
it is your Sense of Beauty.”

“Take what you will from me,” cried Anselm. “I care not so I have one of
those wondrous purses.”

“Listen first, Anselm,” said the woman, and solemnly, as she had warned
Jasmine, so she warned him that the magic money could be spent on none
save himself, and that the sense he sold could be bought back only by
the owner of such another purse.

“Remember, you can never reclaim it yourself,” she repeated.

“I care not! I care not!” exclaimed Anselm. “Quick, the purse!”

“Come hither,” said the woman, “and close your eyes.” Gently she touched
him on both eyelids, and drew forth his Sense of Beauty. Then she handed
him a red-tasselled bag exactly the same as Jasmine’s and as heavy with
golden guineas.

“Now farewell, Anselm. Go forth into a bleak world.”

Wild with joy and excitement, Anselm dashed from the Bargain House and
hastened through the deep, dark forest to that part of the city where
dwelt the grandest merchants. Here he bought gorgeous apparel, costly
wines, and magnificent horses. Astride the finest of the horses, a
gleaming chestnut, said to be the swiftest steed alive, he then rode
home through the forest. As he went, he met an old man clad in wretched
rags, who looked very hungry and tired. Feeling pleased with life Anselm
plunged his hand into the magic purse, and, drawing forth a golden
guinea, flung it at the poor man, who joyfully stooped to pick it up.
But no sooner had his hand touched the coin than it vanished. Anselm
remembered the woman’s warning.

[Illustration: “ANSELM DREW FORTH A GOLDEN GUINEA”]

“Sorry, my good fellow,” he said, shamefacedly handing the beggar two
coppers—all that he could find in his old purse.

“Thanks, noble master. Now I can buy bread for my supper. I never
thought to eat to-night.”

“For one who sups on dry bread you look strangely cheerful,” said
Anselm. “At what can you rejoice?”

“’Tis the beauty of the sunset, master. It seems to warm my heart. Never
have I seen one like to it in glory. Who could look and not be
comforted?”

And, in truth, a radiant smile lit up the old man’s suffering face as he
gazed on the flaming splendours of the western sky. Anselm turned and
looked where the beggar pointed, but he could see nothing that seemed
worth the turning of the head, and with a shrug of the shoulders he rode
home.

Now Jasmine, rejoicing that Anselm would share her feasting, arrayed
herself that she might look her fairest for their banquet. She brushed
her red-gold hair until it shone, and gazed at herself in the mirror
until her beauty glowed. Then she attired herself in a dress of
dragon-flies’ wings, covered all over with hearts made of tiny little
diamonds like dewdrops.

“Never, never have I looked so fair. When Anselm sees me he will love me
more than ever. How joyfully we shall feast together, and how glad am I
that he will no longer want me to laugh at the things he says! I shall
love him far more without his Sense of Humour.”

Her heart beat as she heard footsteps hastening up the stairs. Radiant
with excitement in burst Anselm. “I’m rich!” he cried. “Rich! rich!
Rejoice with me, Jasmine.”

Grey disappointment crushed into Jasmine’s heart, for not one word did
her husband say of her especial beauty or her wonderful dress.

“There’s nothing like wealth!” he cried. “How did we ever endure our
poverty? And fancy, I met a beggar-man, who said he was cheerful because
he looked at the sunset! Ha! ha! ha!”

“Why do you laugh, Anselm? Have you then not sold your Sense of Humour?
How came you then by that purse?”

“No. I may still laugh. I have but parted with my Sense of Beauty.”

“Your Sense of Beauty?” echoed Jasmine, icy fear entering her heart. “Is
that why your eyes no longer seek my face?”

“Why ever do you look so doleful?” laughed Anselm. “Let us hasten down
and feast. My lips thirst for the wines I have bought.”

Trembling, Jasmine pleaded: “Look on my face, husband, the face you have
so often called your glory. What think you of my face to-night?”

“Your face? Let me look. It seems all right: two eyes, one nose, one
mouth. Yes, it seems just as other faces are.”

It was with a sad heart poor Jasmine sat at the feast that night. Loving
her husband, she rejoiced to see him revel, but that he should no longer
gaze at her with the admiration which had been her delight was pain past
bearing. Anselm enjoyed his feasting, but the wine made jokes rise in
his mind, to flutter from his lips, and it vexed him that no smile ever
widened his wife’s mouth, set for ever in still solemnity.

Days, weeks, months passed. Anselm and Jasmine now lived in a gorgeous
palace. They were clad in the finest raiment and they feasted like
emperors, but in their hearts all was becoming as dust and ashes.

“Ah me!” sighed Jasmine. “I know now why it was that I longed for
wealth. It was that I might add to my beauty and see even more
admiration in my beloved’s eyes. Of what use to me are my gorgeous
gowns, my jewels, my flower-like face, since Anselm no longer delights
to see me.”

And for Anselm the pleasures of feasting and luxurious living soon
palled. His wife could not laugh at his jokes, and in the wide world
there was nothing for him to admire. Neither sunsets, nor courage, nor
self-sacrifice. He could see no beauty in any face, thought or action.
Lost to him were the delights of Poetry and all the loveliness of
Nature.

“What is there in life,” he cried, “but feasting and laughter? If only
Jasmine could join with me in mocking at the absurdities of Man!”

Desperately he strove to restore laughter to his mirthless wife. He
engaged a thousand jesters and promised a fortune to him who should make
her laugh. Everything human beings consider funny was shown to her.
Orange peel was plentifully scattered outside the palace windows, and
aged men encouraged to walk past, that they might step on the orange
peel and fall. Then, by means of huge bellows purposely placed, their
hats were blown from off their heads, in the hope that Jasmine would
smile to see the poor old fellows vainly chasing their own headgear. But
all in vain. Nothing amused Jasmine, neither physical misfortune nor the
finest wit. Her mouth remained set. Daily Anselm laughed louder and
longer, but into his laughter an ugly bitterness had come. It was now
the laughter of mockery, no longer softened by admiration.

During that summer a child was born to Jasmine. For years she had longed
for a baby, but now that the funny little creature squirmed in her arms,
yawning, and making faces, she thought it merely ugly and turned from it
in disgust.

A few months later the coachman’s wife gave birth to a baby, and Jasmine
went to visit her. She found her by the fire, nursing a red, hairless,
wrinkled daughter that seemed to Jasmine the ugliest morsel in all the
world. In speechless horror she stared at it. Opening wide its shapeless
mouth, the baby stretched its tiny arms and gave a great yawn. With a
joyful laugh, the mother clutched it to her heart. “Oh, you darling,
darling!” she cried. “Could anyone not love anything so _funny_?”

“Is Love then born of Laughter?” cried poor Jasmine, and, full of bitter
envy, she rushed from the room.

That same year a terrible war was waged and thousands of soldiers went
forth to die. One day, Jasmine gazed out of the window. Brave music was
playing, and with colours flying, a gallant host of youths marched past,
their weeping mothers and sweethearts waving farewell.

“A disgusting sight, is it not?” said Anselm. “All these boys striding
off to be killed simply because their foolish kings have quarrelled!”

“Yes,” replied Jasmine, her eyes full of tears. “But beautiful, too.”

“Beautiful?” jeered her husband with a harsh, discordant laugh. “You
fool! What beauty can there be in senseless sacrifice?” And, as now
often happened, these two fell into loud and bitter wrangling.

Thus daily life became more and more unbearable to Anselm and Jasmine.
In spite of all their wealth, boredom pressed heavily upon them. Since
she could not laugh, and he could not admire, to both the world seemed
full of senseless suffering.

“I can no longer bear this life,” said Jasmine, one day. “Of what use is
the beauty to which Anselm is blind? I will seek the Bargain House and
buy back the Sense he sold. He will still have his purse with which to
buy the luxuries he loves.” And forth she went into the deep, dark
forest.

An hour later, Anselm exclaimed:

“I can no longer bear this life. I will buy back Jasmine’s humour that
at least we may together mock at this senseless life. She will still
have her purse to buy the fineries she loves.” And forth he went into
the deep, dark forest.

That evening Jasmine returned without her magic purse, rejoicing that
her husband would once more delight in her beauty. She went to say good
night to her little son, who lay in his cot, struggling to draw his tiny
toes up into his mouth. The window was open. Suddenly he stretched forth
his arms towards the shining moon. It looked so good to suck; he longed
to grasp it. He struggled and bubbled and clutched, his crinkled face
growing crimson with effort. How funny he looked! Suddenly, Jasmine
found herself laughing—laughing—laughing until her whole body shook, and
happy peals broke through her astonished lips. “Oh, you darling, darling
little joke,” she cried, joyfully kissing her child.

At that moment in rushed Anselm, and stood transfixed at the dazzling
beauty of his wife.

“Jasmine, Jasmine,” he cried, “what has happened. Why are you so
dazzlingly beautiful?”

“Because I have no longer a magic purse. I have bought you back your
Sense, husband.”

“You too?” cried Anselm; “and I have bought back your laughter.”

“Then we are both poor! Oh, how funny!” cried Jasmine, her laughter
growing louder and louder as they fell into one another’s arms.

Thus Anselm and Jasmine parted with their magic purses, and had to work
for their daily bread, but they lived happily ever afterwards in a world
that was blessedly beautiful and blessedly funny.

             The Joyous Ballad of the Parson and the Badger

                                                           HENRY NEWBOLT


      Not far from Guildford town there lies
          A house called Orange Grove,
      And there his trade a Parson plies,
          Whom all good people love.

            Sing up, sing down, for Guildford town,
                And sing for the Parson too!
            I’ll wager a penny you’ll never find any
                That’s more of a sportsman true.

      A neighbour came in haste one day
          With a piteous tale to tell,
      But “A badger, a badger,” was all he could say,
          When they answered the front door bell.

            Sing in, sing out, there’s a badger about,
                Send word to the County Police.
            He’s playing the dickens with all the spring chickens,
                And gobbling up the geese.

      Forth to the fray the Parson goes
          Beneath the midnight sky,
      He threads the wood on the tip of his toes
          And he climbs a fir-tree high.

            Sing never a word, it’s quite absurd
                To expect a badger to come
            And sit to be shot like a bottle or pot
                To the sound of an idiot’s hum!

      The clock has struck both twelve and one,
          His eyes are heavy as lead,
      He heartily wishes the deed were done
          And himself at home in bed.

            Sing ho! Sing hey! the badger’s away,
                The Parson’s up the tree:
            It’s horribly damp and he’s got the cramp
                And there’s nothing at all to see.

      The clock struck two, and then half-past,
          The day began to break;
      The badger came back to his earth at last
          And found our friend awake.

            Sing boom and bang! the welkin rang,
                The Parson, “Hurrah!” he cried:
            The badger lay there with his legs in the air
                And an ounce of shot inside.

      Happy at heart, though in pitiful plight,
          The victor crawled away;
      He slept the sleep of the just all night
          And half of the following day.

            Sing loud and strong, sing all day long,
                Sing Yoicks! and Hullabaloo!
            But I’ve had enough of this doggerel stuff
                And so, I should think, have you!

              Though cats and birds be hardly friends,
                  We doubt the Maeterlinckian word
              That must dishonour the White Cat,
                  Even to honour the Blue Bird.

              And if once more in later days
                  His baseless charge the Belgian brings,
              Great ghosts shall rise to vindicate
                  The right of cats to look at kings.

               And hear the ancient bells anew,

               What glorious fortunes followed when
                   He let the cat out of the bag.

               And Gray shall leave the graves of Stoke

               Cowper, who, beaming at his cat,
                   Forgot the shadow on his soul.

                   Of milk, on which the kitten thrives,
               Feline felicities to you
                   And nine extremely prosperous lives.




                    Scenes in the Life of a Princess

                                                         CHARLES WHIBLEY


                               _Ashridge_

When Queen Mary was persuaded, falsely, that her throne could be made
safe only by the death of her sister, then but eighteen years old, the
Princess Elizabeth lay sick at Ashridge. One spring morning, as she
tossed abed, ’twixt sleeping and waking, in the weariness of fever, she
heard in the courtyard beneath her window the tramp of men, the clatter
of horses’ hoofs. Her affrighted servants brought her word that a guard
of two hundred and fifty horsemen attended the Lords, who came with
messages from the Queen, a guard larger than enough to keep watch over
so frail a Princess. The house being thus begirt, Lord Thame and his
companions, thrust their way into the presence of the Princess. To her
demand that if not for courtesy, yet for modesty’s sake, they should put
off the delivery of their message till the morrow, they answered that
their commission was to bring her to London, alive or dead.

“A sore commission,” said the Princess, but a commission not to be
gainsaid. And the Queen’s doctors showed her little pity. She might be
removed, said they, not without danger, yet without death.

So on the morrow, the sad cavalcade set forth. The Princess, that she
might be the more darkly shielded from the public gaze, was borne in the
Queen’s own litter, which she presently bade to be opened, and thus she
made her progress to Whitehall in the full view of the people. It was a
tedious and a painful journey. From Ashridge, by St. Alban’s, she came
to South Mymms, where again she rested her weary body, and not until
four suns had set did she reach the inhospitable Court of Mary, her
Queen and her sister.


                              _Whitehall_

When she came to Whitehall, she was still a prisoner. It was as though
she carried her dungeon with her. Whitehall was less kind even than the
white high road, where at least she had found solace in the pity of the
humble folk, who wept as she passed, and offered prayers for her safety.
Fourteen days she spent in unfriended seclusion, with “no comfort but
her innocence, no companion but her book.” Not for her the freedom of
the open air, the chatter of tongues, the laughter of friends. Her
oft-repeated request to see her sister fell upon the deaf ears of her
jailers. A princess of less courage would have quailed before the
ill-omened silence which enwrapped her. And how could she hope to regain
the Queen’s affection, so long as the cunning servants of the Emperor
and the King of France, Renard and Noailles, were there to distil the
poison of hate and dread in Queen Mary’s ear?

Knowing well that her foes were the Queen’s friends, her friends the
Queen’s foes, she was still of a stout heart. When Gardiner, the Bishop
of Winchester, resolute to entrap her, urged her to confess and to
submit herself to the Queen’s Majesty, “submission,” said she proudly,
“confessed a crime, and pardon belonged to a delinquent.” For her part
she had no crime to confess, and she asked no pardon. So for her
temerity she was told that two hundred Northern Whitecoats should guard
her lodging that night, and that in the morn she should be secretly
conveyed to the Tower, without her household, there to be kept a close
prisoner.


                              _The Tower_

It was a Palm Sunday when she set forth, under a guard, to that place of
ill-omen, the Tower of London. Hers was no triumphal progress; neither
palm nor willow was carried in her honour. And well might she dread the
journey, which she was forced to make. Within the dark walls of the
Tower her mother had laid her fair head down upon the block; and what
cause had she to hope for a happier destiny? As she left Whitehall, to
her a place of durance, she looked up to the window of the Queen’s
bedchamber, hoping there to see some mark of favour, some signal of
affection. The hope was vain, and in cold despair she came to the
Stairs, where the barges awaited her. When she reached the Tower, she
was bidden to enter at the Traitor’s Gate, which at first she refused,
and then stepping short so that her foot fell into the water, she spake
these words to her obdurate jailer:

“Here landeth as true a subject, being prisoner, as ever landed at these
stairs, since Julius Cæsar laid the first foundations of the Tower.”

The Constable, a wry-faced ruffian, lurched forth savagely to receive
her, and in a harsh voice told her that he would show her her lodging.
Then she, being faint, “sat down,” we are told, “upon a fair stone, at
which time there fell a great shower of rain: the heavens themselves did
seem to weep at such inhuman usage.”

  SCENES IN THE LIFE OF A PRINCESS

  “They answered that their commission was to bring her to London, alive
    or dead.”
]

  _Drawn for “The Flying Carpet”
          by H. M. Brock_

Presently she was locked and bolted in the Tower; her own servants were
taken from her; to open her casement, that she might enjoy the fresh air
of heaven, to walk in the garden—these were pleasures denied her. One
sole thing was constantly demanded of her, that she should confess
herself a rebel and submit herself to the Queen. Nobly did she refuse,
and was left to silence and her own proud thoughts.


                            _Hampton Court_

She changed her prison, and kept unchanged her high courage. From the
Tower she was carried to Woodstock. But what mattered it where the
dungeon lay? The locks and bolts were no more easily burst asunder at
Woodstock than at the Tower. And then of a sudden her keeper was bidden
to bring her to Hampton Court, not as a free Princess, but as a guarded
malefactor. At Colnbrook, where on the way she sojourned at the sign of
the George, certain gentlemen, devoted to her service, came to do her
homage. Instantly, at the Queen’s command, they were sent about their
business, and the Princess was bidden to enter Hampton Court, without an
escort, and by the back gate, like the humblest menial. Again for many
days she was left solitary and in silence, when she was summoned one
night into the presence of the Queen, her sister, whose heavy hand she
had felt unceasingly, whose face she had not seen for two long years.
The Queen, sitting on her chair of State, took up her promise of loyalty
sharply and shortly.

“Then you will not confess yourself,” said she, “to be a delinquent, I
see, but stand peremptorily upon your truth and innocence; I pray God
they may so fall out.”

To which the Princess replied: “If not, I neither require favour nor
pardon at your Majesty’s hands.”

“Well,” said the Queen, “then you stand so stiffly upon your faith and
loyalty, that you suppose yourself to have been wrongfully punished and
imprisoned.”

“I cannot,” replied the Princess, “nor must not say so to you.”

“Why then belike,” retorted the Queen, “you will report it to others.”

“Not so,” said the Princess. “I have borne and must bear the burden
myself.”

The two sisters never met again, but the Princess’s courage in facing
her fate was not in vain. Thenceforth she was eased of her imprisonment,
and went to Ashridge in free custody, where she remained at her
pleasure, until Queen Mary’s death.


                      _A Progress through London_

In 1558 the Queen died, and the Princess Elizabeth, justified of her
patience and her courage, was proclaimed Queen of England. In the loyal
enthusiasm of her subjects, who had long since acclaimed her in their
hearts, the years of solitude and imprisonment were forgotten. To the
Tower, which she had left a captive, she returned a monarch, and passed
in triumph through her City of London to Westminster. Everywhere she was
welcomed by pageants and loyal discourse, until she came to the famous
Abbey where she was crowned, to the contentment of her loyal lieges and
to the honour and glory of her realm.




                         Neil and Tintinnabulum

                        AN INTERLUDE FOR PARENTS

                                                         BY J. M. BARRIE


                            1. _Early Days_

In writing a story a safe plan must be to imitate your favourite author.
Until he was nine, when he abandoned the calling, Neil was my favourite
author, and I therefore decide to follow his method of dividing the
story into short chapters so as to make it look longer.

When he was nine I took him to his preparatory, he prancing in the
glories of the unknown until the hour came for me to go, “the hour
between the dog and the wolf,” and then he was afraid. I said that in
the holidays all would be just as it had been before, but the newly-wise
one shook his head; and on my return home, when I wandered out unmanned
to look at his tool-shed, I found these smashing words in his writing
pinned to the door:

             THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS NOW PERMANENTLY CLOSED.

I went white as I saw that Neil already understood life better than I
did.

Soon again he was on the wing. Here is interesting autobiographical
matter I culled years later from the fly-leaf of his _Cæsar_: “Aetat 12,
height 4 ft. 11, biceps 8¼, kicks the beam at 6-2.”

The reference is to a great occasion when Neil stripped at his
preparatory (clandestinely) for a Belt with the word “Bruiser” on it. I
am reluctant to boast about him (this is untrue), yet must mention that
he won the belt, with which (such are the ups and downs of life) he was
that same evening gently belted by his preceptor.

It is but fair to Neil to add that he cut a glittering figure in those
circles: captain of the footer, and twenty-six against Juddy’s.

“And even then,” his telegram to me said, “I was only bowled off my
pads.”

A rural cricket match in buttercup time with boys at play, seen and
heard through the trees; it is surely the loveliest scene in England and
the most disarming sound. From the ranks of the unseen dead, for ever
passing along our country lanes on their eternal journey, the Englishman
falls out for a moment to look over the gate of the cricket field and
smile. Let Neil’s 26 against Juddy’s, the first and perhaps the only
time he is to meet the stars on equal terms, be our last sight of him as
a child. He is walking back bat in hand to the pavilion, an old railway
carriage. An unearthly glory has swept over the cricket ground. He tries
to look unaware of it; you know the expression and the bursting heart.
Our smiling Englishman who cannot open the gate waits to make sure that
this boy raises his cap in the one right way (without quite touching it,
you remember), and then rejoins his comrades. Neil gathers up the glory
and tacks it over his bed. “The End,” as he used to say in his letters.

I never know him quite so well again. He seems henceforth to be running
to me on a road that is moving still more rapidly in the opposite
direction.


                          2. _The First Half_

The scene has changed. Stilled is the crow of Neil, for he is now but
one of the lowliest at a great public school, where he reverberates but
little. The scug Neil fearfully running errands for his fag-master is
another melancholy reminder of the brevity of human greatness.

Lately a Colossus he was now infinitely less than nothing. What shook
him was not the bump as he fell, but the general indifference to his
having fallen. He lay there like a bird in the grass winded by a
blunt-headed arrow, and was cold to his own touch. The Bruiser Belt and
his score against Juddy’s had accompanied him to school on their own
legs, one might say, so confident were they of a welcome from his
mantelshelf, but after an hour he hid them beneath the carpet. Hidden by
him all over that once alluring room, as in disgrace, were many other
sweet trifles that went to the making of the flame that had been Neil;
his laugh was secreted, say in the drawer of his desk; his pranks were
stuffed into his hat-box, his fell ambitions were folded away between
two pairs of trousers, and now and then a tear would mix with the soapy
water as he washed his cheerless face.

In that dreadful month or more I am dug up by his needs and come again
into prominence, gloating because he calls for me, sometimes unable to
do more than stand afar off on the playing field, so that he may at
least see me nigh though we cannot touch. The thrill of being the one
needed, which I had never thought to know again. I have leant over a
bridge, and enviously watching the gaiety of two attractive boys, now
broken to the ways of school, have wished he was one of them, till I
heard their language and wondered whether this was part of the necessary
cost.

Leaden-footed Neil in the groves that were to become so joyous to him.
He had to refashion himself on a harsher model, and he set his teeth and
won, blaming me a little for not having broken to him the ugly world we
can make it. One by one his hidden parts peeped out from their holes and
ran to him, once more to make his wings; stronger wings than of yore,
though some drops of dew had to be shaken off.

By that time my visits were being suffered rather than acclaimed. It was
done with an exquisite politeness certainly, but before I was out of
sight he had dived into some hilarious rumpus. Gladly for his sake I
knew my place.

His first distinct success was as a gargler.

[Illustration: “WE GENERALLY GARGLE A SONG”]

“You remember how I used to hate gargling at home,” says an early
letter, “and you forced me to do it. Jolly good thing you did force me.”
His first “jolly” at that school. At once I began to count them.

“Everyone has to gargle just now,” he continues, “and we all do it at
the same time, and it must sound awfully rum to people passing along the
street. We generally gargle a song, and there was a competition in
‘Home, sweet Home’ among the scugs at m’ tutor’s, and the judge said I
gargled it longest.”

Soon afterwards he had the exultation of being recognised as an entity
by one of the masters.

“I was walking with Dolman mi.,” his letter says, “and we met a new beak
called Tiverley and he pretended to fence with me and said ‘Whose
incomparable little noodle are you?’” This, apparently, was all that
happened, but Neil adds with obvious elation, “It was awfully decent of
him.” (Hail to thee, Tiverley, may “a house” anon be thy portion for
heartening a new boy in the dwindling belief that he exists.)

Dolman mi. evidently had no run on this occasion, but he is older and
more famous than Neil (which makes the thing the more flattering). It is
a school whither many royal scions are sent, and when camera men go down
to photograph the new one, Dolman mi. usually takes his place. He has
already been presented to newspaper readers as the heir to three
thrones. Of course it is the older boys who select, scrape and colour
him (if necessary) for this purpose, but they must see something in him
that the smaller boys don’t see.

Neil’s next step was almost a bound forward; he got a tanning from the
head of the house. This also he took in the proper spirit, boasting
indeed of the vigour with which Beverley had laid on. (Thee, also,
Beverley, I salute, as the Immensity who raised Neil from the ranks of
the lowly, the untanned.)

Quite the amiable, sensible little schoolboy, readers may be saying, but
that Neil was amiable or sensible I indignantly deny. He was merely
waiting; that shapely but enquiring nose of his was only considering how
best to strike once more for leadership. So when the time came he was
ready; and he has been striking ever since, indeed, there is nothing
that I think he so much resembles as a clock that has got out of hand.

All the other small boys in his house had the same opportunity, but they
missed it. It was provided by some learned man (name already tossed to
oblivion) who delivered unto them a lecture entitled _Help One Another_.
The others behaved in the usual way, cheered the lecturer heartily when
he took a drink of water, said “Silly old owl!” as they went out and at
once forgot his Message. Not so Neil. With the clearness of vision that
always comes to him when anything to his own advantage is toward, he saw
that the time and the place and the loved one (himself) had arrived
together. Portents in the sky revealed to him that his _métier_ at
school was to Help Others. There would be something sublime about it had
he not also seen with the same vividness that he must make a pecuniary
charge of threepence. He decided astutely to begin with W. W. Daly.

As we write these words an extraordinary change comes over our
narrative. In the dead silence that follows this announcement to our
readers you may hear, if you listen intently, a scurrying of feet, which
is nothing less than Neil being chased out of the story. The situation
is one probably unparalleled in fiction.


                           3. _Tintinnabulum_

Elated by your curiosity we now leave Neil for a moment (say, searching
with his foot for a clean shirt among a pile of clothing on the floor),
mount to the next landing and enter the second room on the left, the
tenant of which immediately dives beneath his table under the impression
that we are a fag-master shouting “Boy.” We drag him out and present him
to you as W. W. Daly. He is five feet one, biceps 7¾, and would probably
kick the beam at about 6½ stone. He is not yet celebrated for anything
except for being able to stick pins into his arm up to the head;
otherwise a creature of small account who, but for Neil’s patronage,
would never have risen to the distinction of being written about, except
perhaps by his mother.

W. W.’s first contact with school was made dark by a strange infirmity,
an incapacity to remember the Latin equivalent for the word “bell.” Many
Latin words were as familiar to him as his socks (perhaps even more so,
for he often wears the socks of others), and those words he would give
you on demand with the brightness of a boy eager to oblige; but daily
did his tutor insist (like one who will have nothing for breakfast but
eggs and bacon) on having “bell” alone. Daily was W. W. floored.

It is now that Neil appears with his sunny offer of Help. He took up the
case so warmly that he entirely neglected his own studies, which is one
of his failings. True he charged threepence (which we shall henceforth
write as 3_d._, as it is so sure to come often into these chronicles),
but this detracts little from his grandeur, for the mere apparatus
required cost him what he calls a bob.

His first procedure was to affix to the bell-pull a card bearing in bold
letters the device “Tintinnabulum.” This seems simple but was
complicated by there being no bell in W. W.’s room. Neil bought a bell
(W. W. being “stony”), and round the walls he constructed a gigantic
contrivance of wire and empty ginger-beer bottles, culminating at one
end in the bell and at the other end in W. W.’s foot as he lay abed. The
calculation, a well-founded one, was that if the sleeper tossed
restlessly the bell would ring and he would awake. He was then, as
instructed by Neil, first, to lie still but as alert as if visited by a
ghost, and to think hard for the word. If, however, it still eluded him
he was to turn upon it the electric torch, kept beneath his pillow for
this purpose and borrowed at 1_d._ per week from Dolman mi., spot the
tricky “Tintinnabulum” in its lair and say the word over to himself a
number of times before returning to his slumbers, something attempted,
something done to earn a night’s repose.

All this did W. W. conscientiously do, and if there was delay in
bringing Tintinnabulum to heel the fault was not that of Neil, but
of inferior youths who used to substitute cards inscribed
“Honorificabilitudinitatibus,” “Porringer,” “Xylobalsamum,”
“Beelzebobulus,” and other likely words.

Eventually he achieved; a hard-won ribbon for his benefactor whom we are
about to call Neil for the last time.

There was a feeling among those who had betted on the result that it
should be celebrated in no uncertain manner, and a dinner with speeches
not being feasible (though undoubtedly he would have liked it), he was
re-christened Tintinnabulum, and the name stuck.

So Tintinnabulum let it be henceforth in these wandering pages. Neil the
disinherited may be pictured pattering back to me on his naked soles and
knocking me up in the night.

“Neil,” I cry (in dressing gown and a candle), “what has happened? Have
you run away from school?”

“Rather not,” says the plaintive ghost, shivering closer to the fire, “I
was kicked out.”

“By your tutor?” I ask blanching.

“No, by Tintinnabulum. He is becoming such a swell among the juniors
that he despises me and the old times. And now he has kicked me out.”

“Drink this hot milk, Neil, and tell me more. What are those articles
you are hugging beneath your pyjamas?”

“They are the Bruiser Belt and the score against Juddy’s. He threw them
out after me.”

“Don’t take it so much to heart, Neil. I’ll find an honoured place for
them here, and you and I will have many a cosy talk by the fire about
Tintinnabulum.”

“I don’t want to talk about him,” he says, his hands so cold that he
spills the milk, “I would rather talk about the days before there was
him.”

Well, perhaps that was what I meant.

Cruel Tintinnabulum.


                       4. _The Best Parlour Game_

Soon after the events described in our last chapter I knew from
Tintinnabulum’s letters that he was again Helping. They were
nevertheless communications so guarded as to be wrapped in mystery.

His letters from school tend at all times to be more full of instruction
for my guidance than of information about where he stands in his form. I
notice that he worries less than did an older generation about how I am
to dress when I visit him, but he is as pressing as ever that the postal
order should be despatched at once, and firmly refuses to write at all
unless I enclose stamped envelopes. On important occasions he even
writes my letters for me, requesting me to copy them carefully and not
to put in any words of my own, as when for some reason they have to be
shown to his tutor. He then writes, “Begin ‘Dear T.’ (not ‘Dearest T.’),
and end ‘Yours affec.’ (not ‘Yours affectionately’).”

The mysterious letters that preceded the holidays were concerned with W.
W. Daly, whom I was bidden (almost ordered) to invite to our home for
that lengthy period, “as his mother is to be away at that time on
frightfully important business in which I have a hand.”

I was instructed to write “Dear Mrs. Daly (not “dearest”), I understand
that you are to be away on important business during the holidays, and
so I have the pleasure to ask you to allow your son to spend the
holidays with me and my boy who is a general favourite and very
diligent. Come, come, I will take no refusal, and I am, Yours affec.”

I did as I was told, but as I now heard of the lady for the first time I
thought it wisest not to sign my letter to her “Yours affec.” Thus did I
fall a victim to Tintinnabulum’s wiles.

What could this frightfully important business of Mrs. Daly’s be in
which he “had a hand”?

[Illustration: “ON IMPORTANT OCCASIONS HE EVEN WRITES MY LETTERS FOR
ME.”]

You may say (when you hear of his dark design) that I should at once
have insisted on an explanation, but explanations are barred in the
sport that he and I play, which is the greatest of all parlour games,
the Game of Trying to Know Each Other without asking questions. It is
strictly a game for two, who, I suppose, should in perfect conditions be
husband and wife; it is played silently and it never lasts less than a
life-time. In panegyrics on love (a word never mentioned between us two
players), the game is usually held to have ended in a draw when they
understand each other so well that before the one speaks or acts the
other knows what he or she is going to say or do. This, however, is a
position never truly reached in the game, and if it were reached, such a
state of coma for the players could only be relieved by a cane in the
hand of the stronger, or by the other bolting, to show him that there
was one thing about her which he had still to learn.

No, no, these doited lovers when they think the haven is in sight have
set sail only. Tintinnabulum and I have made a hundred moves, but we are
well aware that we don’t know each other yet; at least, I don’t know
Tintinnabulum, I won’t swear that he does not think that he at last
knows me. So when he brought W. W. home with him for the holidays it was
for me to find out without inquiry how he had been helping Mrs. Daly
(and for what sum). He knew that I was cogitating, I could see his
impertinent face regarding me demurely, as if we were at a chess board
and his last move had puzzled me, which indeed was the situation.

All I knew of her was that she had lately remarried and that W. W. had
been invited to spend his holidays with us while she was away on her
honeymoon.

Good heavens, could Tintinnabulum have had some Helping part in the
lady’s marriage? This boy is beginning to scare me.

I studied him and W. W. at their meals and stole upon them at their
play. There could not have been more cherubic faces.

But then I remembered the two cherubic faces I had watched from a
bridge.


                    5. _Tintinnabulum Eats an Apple_

I went to Tintinnabulum’s bedchamber and told him I could not rest until
I knew what he had been doing to that lady. In the days of Neil it had
been a room of glamour, especially the bed therein, where were performed
nightly between 6.15 and 6.30 precisely, the brighter plays of
Shakespeare, two actors, but not a sign of them anywhere unless you
became suspicious of the hump in the coverlet. Never have the plays gone
with greater merriment since Mr. Shakespeare made up “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” in his Judith’s hump.

No glamour of course in the room of a public schoolboy, unless it was
provided by his discarded raiment, which lay like islands on the floor.
However, I found Tintinnabulum in affable humour, sitting tailor-like in
bed, dressed in half of his pyjamas, reading a book and eating an apple.
He had doubtless found the apple or the book just as he was about to
enter the other half of his night attire.

“What could I have been doing to her?” he asked invitingly. (He likes to
be hunted.)

The robing of him having been completed, I said with humorous intent,
“You may have been luring her into matrimony against her better
judgment.”

“She is nuts on him,” Tintinnabulum said, taking my remark seriously.

“But you can’t have had anything to do with it?”

He nodded, with his teeth in the apple.

“Of course this is nonsense,” I said, though with a sinking, “you don’t
know her.”

“I didn’t need to know her for a thing like that.”

I tried sarcasm. “I should have thought it was essential.” He shook his
head.

“I heard W. W. say to-day,” I continued in the same vein, “that she is
spending the honeymoon on the Riviera; you are not implying, are you,
that it was you who sent her there?”

“At any rate, if it hadn’t been for me,” he replied, taking a good bite,
“she wouldn’t be on the Riviera and there wouldn’t be a honeymoon.”

I became alarmed. “Take that apple out of your mouth and tell me what
you mean.”

The mysterious boy of the so open countenance, as he told me the queer
tale in bed that night, was superbly unaware of its queerness, and was
more interested in standing on his head to see how far his feet would
reach up the wall. He far exceeded the record that had been left by
Neil.

“I wasn’t the one who made her fond of the chappie,” he said by way of
beginning. “She did that bit herself.”

“Very generous of you to give her that amount of choice,” I conceded.

“But she stuck there,” said he. “It was W. W. who told me how she had
stuck. W. W. has a sister called Patricia. Their mother’s name is
Mildred. That is all I know about her,” he added with great lightness of
touch, “except that I worked the marriage.”

This was the first time I had heard of W. W.’s having a sister.

“He doesn’t speak about her much,” Tintinnabulum explained, “because
they are twins. I say, don’t let on to him that I told you he was a
twin.”

So far as I can gather, W. W. keeps the existence of his girl twin dark
from boys in general in case it should make them think less of him.

“He didn’t ask me to help him out till things were in an awful mess at
home, and then he showed me some of Patricia’s letters.”

“If I were cross-examining you,” I pointed out, “I should say that your
statement is not quite clear. Tell the Jury what you mean, and don’t
blow the apple pits at the portrait of your uncle the bishop.”

“I bet you I get him in the calves twice in three shots,” he said.

“An ignoble ambition,” I told him; “answer my question.”

“Well, you see, Patricia had found out all about her mother’s being fond
of the man. His name begins with K, but I forget the rest of it.”

I ventured to say that the least he could do for a man whose life he had
so strangely altered was to remember his name.

“W. W. will know it,” he said with the carelessness of genius.

“Even now,” I pressed him, “I don’t see where you come in. Did Patricia
object to Mr. K.?”

“Oh, no, she thinks no end of him. So does W. W.” He added handsomely,
“I wouldn’t have let her get married if they had shied at it.”

“In that case——”

“It wasn’t Patricia that was the bother,” he explained, running the
apple up and down his arm like a mouse, “it was Mrs. Daly. You know how
funny ladies are about some things.”

“I do not,” I said severely.

“Well, it was about marrying a second time. Mrs. Daly couldn’t make up
her mind whether it would be fair to W. W. and Patricia. She knew they
liked him all right, but not whether they liked him as much as that.”

“Tell me how Patricia found all this out, and don’t bump about so much.”

“She was watching,” he replied airily. “She is that kind. I daresay the
thing wasn’t difficult to find out if all the stuff she said in her
letters to W. W. was true. They were awful letters, saying her mother
was in anguishes about what was the best thing to do for her progeny.
One letter would say, ‘Mr. K. made a lovely impression on mother to-day
and I don’t think she can resist much longer.’ Then the next would say,
‘I fear all is up, for they have been crying together in the
drawing-room, and when he left he banged the door.’”

“Their mother hadn’t a notion,” Tintinnabulum assured me, making an
eye-glass of the apple, “that they knew there was anything in the wind.”

“Nor would they have had any such notion,” I rapped out, “if they had
been children of an earlier date.”

“I suppose we are cleverer now,” he admitted. He became introspective.
“I expect the war did it. It’s rummy what a difference the war has made.
Before the war no one could hold two eggs in his mouth and hop across a
pole. Now everyone can do it.”

I requested him to stick to the point.

“Why didn’t Patricia the emancipated go to her mother and inform her
that all was well?”

“That is the very thing W. W. and she bickered about in their letters.
He was always writing to her to do that, but she said it would be
unladylike.”

“Very un-shingled of her to trouble about that,” I got in. “But had she
any proposal to make to W. W.?”

“Rather. She was always badgering W. W. to write to their mother saying
they knew all and wanted her to go at it blind. She thought it would
come better from him, being male. That was what made him come to me in
the end. He told me all about it and asked me if I could help.”

“And what was your reply?” I asked with some interest. “Don’t tell me,”
I added hurriedly (we were back at the game, you see), “I want to guess.
You said immediately, ‘All right’?”

He approved.

“Did it ever strike you,” I enquired curiously, “that you might not be
able to help?”

“I can’t remember,” the unfathomable one answered. “I say, would you
like to see me do a dive over your head?”

Offer declined.

“You see,” he continued, “W. W. is rather—rather——”

“Rather a retiring boy when there is trouble ahead,” I suggested. “Well,
what did you devise?”

“I said I couldn’t do anything until I knew the colour of Patricia’s
hair and eyes.”

This took me aback, though it is quite in Tintinnabulum’s manner.

“How could that help?” I had to enquire instead of risking a move.

“I couldn’t get a beginning,” he insisted doggedly, “till I found out
that.” (To this day I don’t know what he meant.)

“No difficulty in finding out from W. W.,” I said.

Here I was wrong. W. W. had no idea of the colour of his dear little
sister’s eyes but presumed that, as he and she were twins, their eyes
must be of the same hue. There followed a scene, undoubtedly worthy of
some supreme artist, in which, by the light of a match, Tintinnabulum
endeavoured to discover colour of W. W.’s eyes, W. W. being again unable
to supply desired information. The match always going out just as
Tintinnabulum was on the eve of discovery, it was decided by him that W.
W. should write to his twin for particulars (letter dictated by
Tintinnabulum). Patricia’s reply was, “Who is it that wants to know?
Eyes too expressive to be blue, too lovely to be grey,” and it irritated
the two seekers after truth.

“We didn’t ask her what colour they were not,” Tintinnabulum said to me
witheringly, “but what colour they were.”

In the end, rather than bother any more with her, they risked putting
her eyes down as browny black. This determined, Tintinnabulum apprized
his client that Patricia was to write the letter that would make their
mother happy. This nearly led to a rupture.

_W. W._ (_sitting_, as they say in the plays, though he might as well be
standing): She can’t write a letter to mother when they are living in
the same house.

_Tintinnabulum_ (_rising_, because W. W. sat): It would be a letter to
you.

_W. W._ (_contemptibly_): That brings me into the thing again.

_Tintinnabulum_: Shut up and listen. The letter isn’t to be posted. Your
mother will find it lying open on Patricia’s desk and read it on the
sly.

_W. W._ (_nobly_): My mother never does things on the sly.

_Tintinnabulum_ (_comprehensively_): Oh.

_W. W._ (_hedging_): What would the letter say?

_Tintinnabulum_: It would show her that you and Patricia knew what she
was after and both wanted her to marry the chappie, and then she could
put it back where she found it and never let on that she had seen it and
make all her arrangements with a happy heart.

_W. W._: That is what we want, but mother wouldn’t read a letter on the
sly.

_Tintinnabulum_ (_after thinking it out when he should have been doing
his prep._): Look here, if she is so fussy we can tell Patricia to leave
the letter open on the floor as if it had blown there, and then when
your mother picks it up to put it back on the desk she can’t help taking
a look at it.

_W. W._: Would that not be reading it on the sly?

_Tintinnabulum_ (_with cheerful cynicism_): Not for a woman.

_W. W._ (_depressed_): It will be an awfully difficult letter to write.

_Tintinnabulum_ (_exultant_): Fearfully.

_W. W._: I don’t think Patricia could do it.

_Tintinnabulum_: Not she. I’ll do it. Then you copy my letter and she
copies yours.

_W. W._: 3_d._?

_Tintinnabulum_: Tons more than that.

This scheme was carried out, Tintinnabulum, after a thoughtful study of
Patricia’s epistolary style, producing something in this manner, no
doubt with the holy look on his face that is always there when he knows
he is concocting a masterpiece. (I regret that he has forgotten what he
said in the introductory passage, which dealt in an artful feminine
manner with her garments and was probably a beauty.)


“Darling Doubly Doubly,

... oh dear, I am so unhappy because I fear the match between darlingest
mummy and Mr. K. is not to be hit off. Oh dear, she blows hot and cold
and it makes me bleed to see the poor man’s anguishes, and you and me
wanting it so much. If only I could think of a lady-like way to tell
mummy that we know she wants it and that we want her to go ahead, but I
cannot, and it would need a wonder of a man to do it. Oh dear, how
lovely it would be, oh dear, how I wish I knew some frightfully clever
person, oh dear——”


“I stopped there,” Tintinnabulum told me. “I meant to put in a lot more
before I finished, but I wouldn’t let myself go on.”

“Why?” I asked eagerly, aware that he had reached a great moment in his
life.

“Because,” he said heavily, “I saw all at once that I had come to the
end.” (We are so undemonstrative that I did not embrace him).

The letter was left as arranged, on Mrs. Daly’s floor, and I may say at
once that everything went as planned by the Master. Can we not see
Mildred (all authors have a right to call their heroine by her Christian
name), opening the door of that room? Her beautiful face is down-cast,
all the luckier for Tintinnabulum and Co., for she at once sees the
life-giving sheet. She picks it up, meaning to replace it on the desk
whence it has so obviously fluttered, when a word catches her eye, and
not intending to read she reads. An exquisite flush tints her face as
she recognises Patricia’s inimitable style. The happy woman is now best
left to herself (Come away, Tintinnabulum, you imp).

Dear (not dearest) heroine, you little know who is responsible for your
raptures, the indifferent lad now trying to twist one leg round his neck
as he finishes his apple. Grudge us not the few minutes in which for
literary purposes we have snatched you from the shores of the blue
Mediterranean. Thither we now return you to cloudless days and to your
K., roses in your cheeks (Tintinnabulum’s roses). And you, O lucky K.,
when you encounter boys of thirteen, might do worse than have a
mysterious prompting to give them a franc or so. I wish you both very
happy, and I am, yours affec.

“Shall I send them your love?” I almost hear myself saying to
Tintinnabulum.

“If you like,” he replies, preoccupied with what is left of an apple
when the apple itself has gone. For it must be admitted of him that he
has not boasted of his achievement. His only comment was modesty itself,
“Two bob,” he said.

It is almost appalling to reflect that no woman who knows Tintinnabulum
(and has two bob) need remain single. And what character apples have,
even when being consumed; if I had given him an orange or a pear this
chapter would be quite different. With such deep thoughts I put out his
light, and took away the other apple which he had hidden beneath his
pillow.


                              6. _Nemesis_

As the holidays waned (and after W. W. was safely stowed away in bed)
Tintinnabulum gratified me by being willing to talk about Neil. If you
had heard us at it you would have sworn that those two had no very close
connection, that Neil was merely some interesting whipper-snapper who
had played about the house until the manlier Tintinnabulum arrived. He
was always spoken of between us as Neil, which obviously suited
Tintinnabulum’s dignity, but I wonder how I took to it so naturally
myself. I hope I am not a queer one.

By that arrangement Tintinnabulum can make artful enquiries, not
unwistful, into his own past, and I can seem (thus goes the game) not to
know that he is doing so. He can even commend Neil.

“Pretty decent of him,” he says, discussing the Bruiser Belt and the
score against Juddy’s.

“I didn’t think he had it in him,” is even stronger about the sea-trout
Neil had landed and been so proud of that he would not lie prone till it
was put in a basin by his bedside. He had then slept with one arm over
the basin.

Strongest of all is to say that Neil was mad, at present a term not only
of approval but even of endearment at the only school that counts
(Tintinnabulum speaking). Sometimes we talk of the dark period when
Neil, weeping over his first Latin grammar, used to put a merry tune on
the gramophone to accompany his woe. He continued to weep as he studied,
but always rose at the right time to change the tune. This is a
heart-breaker of a memory to me, and Tintinnabulum knows it and puts his
hand deliciously on my shoulder (that kindest gesture of man to man).

“The gander must have been mad, quite mad,” he says hurriedly.

How Neil would like to hear Tintinnabulum saying these nice things about
him.

Perhaps we all have a Neil. Have you ever wakened suddenly in the night,
certain that you heard a bell ring as it once rang or a knocking on your
door as only one could knock or a voice of long ago, quite close?
Sometimes you rise and wander the house; more often, after waiting alert
for a repetition of the sound, you decide that you have been dreaming or
that it was the creaking of a window or a board. But I daresay it was
none of these things. I daresay it was your Neil.

Perhaps you have become something quite different from what he meant to
be. Perhaps he wants to get into the house, not to gaze proudly at you
but to strike you.

Some drop their Neil deliberately and can recall clearly the day of the
great decision, but most are unaware that he has gone. For instance, it
may have been Neil who married the lady and you who gradually took his
place, so like him in appearance that she is as deceived as you. Or it
may be that she has found you out and knows who it is that is knocking
on the door trying to get back to her. You might be scared if you knew
that though she is at this moment attending to your wants with a smile
for you on her face, her passionate wish is to be done with you. On the
other hand, you may be the better fellow of the two. Let us decide that
this is how it is.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The last week of the holidays was darkened for Tintinnabulum and W. W.
by the shadow of a letter demanded of them by their tutor. It had to be
on one of three subjects:

                    (_a_) Your Favourite Walk.
                    (_b_) Your Favourite Game.
                    (_c_) What shall I do next Half?

A nasty tag attached to m’ tutor’s order said “the letter must be of
great length.” Little had they troubled about it till the end loomed,
but then they rumbled wrathfully; well was it for their tutor he heard
not what they said of him.

Tintinnabulum of course was merely lazy, or on principle resented
writing anything for less than 3_d._ Grievous, however, was the burden
on W. W., whose gifts lie not in a literary direction. He is always
undone by his clear-headed way of putting everything he knows on any
subject into the first sentence. He had a shot at (_a_), (_b_) and
(_c_).

_Attempt on (a)._ “My favourite walk is when I do not have far to go to
it.” (Here he stuck.)

_Attempt on (b)._ “The game of cricket is my favourite game, and it
consists of six stumps, two bats and a ball.” After wandering round the
table many times he added, “Nor must we forget the bails.” (Stuck
again.)

_Attempt on (c)._ “Next half is summer half, so early school will be
half an hour earlier.” (Final stick.)

He then abandoned hope and would, I suppose, have had to run away to sea
(if boys still do that) had not Help been nigh.

For a consideration (and you can now guess exactly how much it was)
Tintinnabulum offered to write W. W.’s letter for him. I did not see it
till later (as you shall learn), indeed the episode was purposely kept
dark from me. The subject chosen was “My Favourite Walk,” because
Tintinnabulum had a book entitled Walks and Talks with the Little Ones,
which never before had he thought might come in handy. Of course such a
performer by no means confined himself to purloining from this work,
though he did have something to say about how W. W. wandered along his
walk carrying a little book into which he put “interesting plants.”
Anything less like W. W. thus engaged I cannot conceive, unless it be
Tintinnabulum himself.

The miscreant also carefully misspelt several words, as being natural to
W. W. Unfortunately (his fatal weakness) he could not keep his own name
out of the letter, and he made W. W. say that the favourite walk was
“near the house of my kind friend Tintinnabulum, and you know him, sir,
for he is in your house, and I mess with him, which is very lucky for
me, all the scugs wanting to mess with him and nobody wanting me.”

Could brainy critics, peeled for the pounce, read that human document
they would doubtless pause to enquire into its hidden meaning. On the
surface it was written (_a_) to get 3_d._ out of W. W., (_b_) to give
relief to Tintinnabulum’s ego. To the ordinary reader (with whom to-day
we have no concern) this might suffice, but the digger would ask, what
is the philosophy of life advanced by the author, is the whole thing an
allegory and if so, what is Tintinnabulum’s Message; in short, is he,
like the commoner writers, merely saying what he says, or, like the big
chaps, something quite different?

Had his tutor considered the letter thus, we might have had a most
interesting analysis of it (and no one would have been more interested
than Tintinnabulum). But though a favourite of mine (and also of
Tintinnabulum) his tutor is just slightly Victorian, and he went for the
letter like one of the illiterate.

It was not seen by me until the two hopefuls returned to school, when I
received it from their tutor with another one which is uncommonly like
it. Investigation has elicited the following data, for which kindly
allow me to use (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_) again, as I have taken a fancy to
them.

(_a_) Letter is read and approved by W. W.

(_b_) W. W. on reflection objects to passage about the honour of messing
with Tintinnabulum.

(_c_) Ultimatum issued by Tintinnabulum that the passage must be
retained.

(_d_) MS. haughtily returned to the author.

(_e_) The author alters a few words and sends in letter as his own.

(_f_) W. W. has made a secret copy of the letter and sends it in as his,
with the objectionable passage deleted.

(_g_) Their tutor smells a rat.

(_h_) He takes me into his confidence.

(_i_) Days pass but I remain inactive.

(_j_) He puts the affair into the hands of Beverley, the head of the
house.

(_k_) Triumph of Miss Rachel.

Miss Rachel who is an old friend of ours is slight and frail, say 5 ft.
3, her biceps cannot be formidable and I question whether she could kick
the beam however favourably it was placed for her. She is such an
admirer of Tintinnabulum that he occasionally writhes, in his fuller
knowledge of the subject.

Having led a quiet and uneventful life (so far as I know), Miss Rachel
suddenly shoots into the light through her acquaintance with the
Beverleys of Winch Park, which is, as it were, nothing; but the great
Beverley, Beverley the thunderous, who is head of m’ tutor’s house, is a
scion of that family; and now you see what a swell Miss Rachel has
become. When Neil (as he then was) was entered for that great school she
wrote to Beverley—fancy knowing someone who can write to
Beverley—telling him (to Neil’s indignation) what a darling her young
friend was and hoping Beverley would look after him and make him his
dear little fag. Months elapsed before a reply came, but when it did
come it really referred to Tintinnabulum and contained these pregnant
words: “As to the person in whom you are interested, I look after him a
good deal, and the more I see of him the more I lick him.”

Miss Rachel showed me the letter with exultation. So kind of him, she
said, though she was a little distressed that a strapping fellow like
Beverley should spell so badly.

More recently I had a letter from Tintinnabulum, which I showed to her
as probably denoting the final transaction in the affair of the letter.

“W. W. and I,” it announced very cheerily, “saw Beverley yesterday in
his room and he gave each of us six of the best.”

“How charming of Beverley!” Miss Rachel said.

“The best what?” she enquired, but I cannot have heard her, for I made
no answer.

I learn that sometimes she thinks it was probably cakes and at other
times fives balls, which she knows to be in great demand at that school.
I shall not be surprised if Miss Rachel sends a dozen of the best to
Beverley.


                      7. _How to Write a Collins_

I note that the dozen of the best shared by these two odd creatures
seems to have made them pals again. The proof is that though they began
the new half by messing with other youths they are now once more messing
together.

“That priceless young cub, W. W.,” occurs in one letter of
Tintinnabulum’s.

“W. W. is the lad for me,” he says in the next.

Again, I have a note of thanks for hospitality from W. W. in which he
remarks, “Tintinnabulum is as ripping as ever.” This, however, is to be
discounted, as, though the letter is signed W. W. Daly, I recognise in
it another hand, I recognise this other hand so clearly that I can add a
comment in brackets (3_d._).

Yes, I can do so (because of a game I have long been playing), but any
other person would be deceived, just as m’ tutor was at first deceived
by the epistles on the favourite walk. He told me that these were so
fragrant of W. W. that he had thought Tintinnabulum must be the
copy-cat. Indeed, thus it was held until W. W. nobly made confession.

What I must face is this, that Tintinnabulum, being (alas) an artist,
has been inside W. W. Not only so, he has since his return to school
been inside at least half a dozen other boys, searching for Collinses
for them.

A Collins, as no one, perhaps except Miss Austen, needs to be told, is
the fashionable name for a letter of thanks for hospitality to a host or
hostess. Thus W. W.’s letter to me was a Collins. Somehow its fame has
spread through his house, and now Tintinnabulum is as one possessed,
writing threepenny Collinses for the deficient. They are small boys as
yet, but as the quality of his Help is trumpeted to other houses I
conceive Fields, Blues and Choices knocking at his door and begging for
a Collins. It will be a great day for Tintinnabulum when Beverley
applies.

The Collins letter is a fine art in which those who try the hardest
often fall most heavily, and perhaps even m’ tutor or the Provost
Himself, at his wit’s end how to put it neatly this time, will yet crave
a 3_d._ worth. It may even be that readers grown grey in the country’s
service, who quake at thought of the looming Collins, would like to have
Tintinnabulum’s address. It is refused; but I mention, to fret them,
that his every Collins is guaranteed different from all his other
Collinses, and to be so like the purchaser that it is a photograph.

If you were his client you could accept Saturday to Monday invitations
with a light heart. But don’t, when he is at your Collins, go near him
and the babe lest he clutch it to his breast and growl. He has the great
gift of growling, which will yet make him popular with another sex.

His concentration on the insides of others is of course very disturbing
to me, but I should feel still more alarmed if I heard that he had
abandoned the monetary charge and, for sheer love of the thing, was
turning out Collinses gratis.

To-day there comes a ray of hope from a harassed tutor, who writes that
Tintinnabulum has deserted the Collins for googly bowling, the secrets
of which he is pursuing with the same terrific intensity. I can picture
him getting inside the ball.


                       8. _He and I and Another_

You readers may smile when I tell you why I have indited these memories
and fancies. It was not done for you but for me, being a foolish attempt
to determine, by writing the things down (playing over by myself some of
the past moves in the game), whether Tintinnabulum really does like me
still. That he should do so is very important to me as he recedes
farther from my ken down that road which hurries him from me. I cannot,
however, after all, give myself a very definite answer. He no longer
needs me of course, as Neil did, and he will go on needing me less. When
I think of Neil I know that those were the last days in which I was
alive.

Tintinnabulum’s opinion of himself, except when he is splashing, is
lowlier than was Neil’s; some times in dark moods it is lowlier than
makes for happiness. He has hardened a little since he was Neil,
coarsened but strengthened. I comfort myself with the curious reflection
that the best men I have known have had a touch of coarseness in them.

Perhaps I have made too much of the occasional yieldings of this boy
whom I now know so superficially. The new life is building seven walls
around him. Are such of his moves in the game as I can follow merely an
expert’s kindness to an indifferent player?

On the other hand, I learn from a friendly source that he has spoken of
me with approval, once at least, as “mad, quite mad,” and I know that my
battered countenance, about which I am very “touchy” excites his pity as
well as his private mirth. On the last night of the holidays he was
specially gruff, but he slipped beneath my door a paper containing the
words “I hereby solemnly promise never to give you cause for moral
anxiety,” and signed his name across a postage stamp to give the
document a special significance. Nevertheless, W. W. and he certainly do
at times exchange disturbing glances of which I am the object, and
these, I notice, occur when I think I am talking well. Again, if I set
off to tell a humorous story in company nothing can exceed the agony on
Tintinnabulum’s face. Yet I am uncertain that this is not a compliment,
for if he felt indifferently toward me why should he worry about my
fate?

During those holidays a master at his old preparatory sent me a letter
he had received from Tintinnabulum (whom he called Neil), saying that as
it was about me he considered I ought to read it. But I had not the
courage to do so. Quite likely it was favourable, but suppose it hadn’t
been. Besides, it was not meant for me to see, and I cling to his
dew-drop about my being mad. On the whole, I think he is still partial
to me. Corroboration, I consider, was provided at our parting, when he
so skilfully turned what began as a tear into a wink and gazed at me
from the disappearing train with what I swear was a loving scowl.

What will become of Tintinnabulum? There was a horror looking for him in
his childhood. Waking dreams we called them, and they lured Neil out of
bed in the night. It was always the same nameless enemy he was seeking,
and he stole about in various parts of the house in search of it,
probing fiercely for it in cupboards, or standing at the top of the
stairs pouring out invective and shouting challenges to it to come up. I
have known the small white figure defend the stair-head thus for an
hour, blazing rather than afraid, concentrated on some dreadful matter
in which, tragically, none could aid him. I stood or sat by him, like a
man in an adjoining world, waiting till he returned to me, for I had
been advised, warned, that I must not wake him abruptly. Gradually I
soothed him back to bed, and though my presence there in the morning
told him, in the light language we then adopted, that he had been “at it
again” he could remember nothing of who the enemy was. It had something
to do with the number 7; that was all we ever knew. Once I slipped from
the room, thinking it best that he should wake to normal surroundings,
but that was a mistake. He was violently agitated by my absence. In some
vague way he seemed on the stairs to have known that I was with him and
to have got comfort from it; he said he had gone back to bed only
because he knew I should be there when he woke up. I found that he
liked, “after he had been an ass,” to wake up seeing me “sitting there
doing something frightfully ordinary, like reading the newspaper,” and
you may be sure that thereafter that was what I was doing.

After he had been a year or two at his preparatory, Neil did a nice
thing for me; one of a thousand. I had shaken my head over his standing
so low in Maths, though he was already a promising classic, and had said
that it was “great fun to be good at what one was bad at.” A term or two
later when he came home he thrust the Maths prize into my hand. “But it
wasn’t fun,” he growled. (It was Neil’s growl before it was
Tintinnabulum’s.) He came back to blurt out, “I did it because in those
bad times you were always sitting there with the newspaper when I woke.”

By becoming Tintinnabulum he is not done with his unknown foe, though I
think they have met but once. On this occasion his dame had remained
with him all night, as he had been slightly unwell, and she was amused,
but nothing more, to see him, without observing her, rise and search the
room in a fury of words for something that was not there. The only word
she caught was “seven.” He asked them not to tell me of this incident,
as he knew it would trouble me. I was told, and, indeed, almost expected
the news, for I had sprung out of bed that night thinking I heard Neil
once again defending the stair. By the time I reached Tintinnabulum it
had ceased to worry him. “But when I woke I missed the newspaper,” he
said with his adorable smile, and again putting his hand on my shoulder.
How I wished “the newspaper” could have been there. There are times when
a boy can be as lonely as God.

[Illustration: “I DID IT BECAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS SITTING THERE WITH THE
NEWSPAPER WHEN I WOKE”]

What is the danger? What is it that he knows in the times during which
he is shut away and that he cannot remember to tell to himself or to me
when he wakes? I am often disturbed when thinking of him (which is the
real business of my life), regretting that, in spite of advice and
warnings, I did not long ago risk waking him abruptly, when, before it
could hide, he might have clapped seeing eyes upon it, and thus been
able to warn me. Then, knowing the danger, I would for ever after be on
the watch myself, so that when the moment came, I could envelop him as
with wings. These are, of course, only foolish fears of the dark, and
with morning they all fly away. Tintinnabulum makes very merry over
them. I have a new thought that, when he is inside me, he may leave them
there deliberately to play upon my weakness for him and so increase his
sock allowance. Is the baffling creature capable of this enormity? With
bowed head I must admit he is. I make a note, to be more severe with him
this half.

                               The Dream

                                                         HERBERT ASQUITH


              My dream? Can I remember my dream?
                  I was floating down the nursery stair,
              And my little terrier ran in front
                  With his feet treading on the air;
              And when we came to the dining-room,
                  The King and the Queen were there:
              And father and mother, two and two;
              And a baby elephant from the Zoo,
                  Each on a golden chair;
              And three soldiers, and Mary Rose
              Riding an ostrich that pecked her toes,
                  And Uncle Jim
                  Looking very trim,
              Eating a kipper.
                  And, when they had sung to the King,
                  They all sat down in a ring,
              And played at hunt the slipper.

              Then I saw a curling stream
                  And yellow flow’rs in a meadow,
              And six little green frogs
                  Dancing a jig in the shadow:
              And the tune came from a bough,
                  “Tweet, tweet, quiver,”
              Sung by a little brown bird
                  That swayed above the river.

              Then we all started to dance,
                  And Aunt Rebecca too;
              Uncle Jim began to prance,
                  And the baby elephant blew
              A curl of smoke from his cigar,
                  As he sat and watched the evening star.
              And the little brown bird sang on,
                  Swaying above the river:
              But a wind came whispering down,
                  And the leaves began to shiver.

              Then with a crackly sound
                  Uncle Jim went flat:
                  He turned into a cricket-bat;
              But Aunt Rebecca grew very round
                  And floated up like a black balloon,
                  Higher and higher, into the Moon.
              The stars fell out of the sky;
                  The baby elephant whined:
              “Time to get up” said nurse:
                  And “Flap” went the blind.

                              Mr. Snoogles

                                                    By Elizabeth Lowndes


Veronica lay very still in bed, then she stretched out as far as she
could. Her feet travelled down to that cold region near where the sheets
and blankets disappear under the mattress. She was certainly still
awake, for one doesn’t stretch in dreams, and if one did one would
certainly wake up.

Then she cautiously raised herself upon one elbow and looked round,
slowly, at the fire. Ever since Teddy had said that Mr. Snoogles lived
up the chimney she had regarded the fire with much greater interest, not
to say dread. Not that Mr. Snoogles was real. He was just fun. And yet,
though Veronica knew he was only fun, she often wondered how he managed
to fit in the inside of the chimney—if, that is, he was at all like
father, or even Dr. Blackie (who wasn’t at all big for a man). But then
Teddy was the only person who claimed to have ever seen this person who
had taken refuge in their chimneys, and he couldn’t be made to describe
him.

In the morning and in the afternoon Mr. Snoogles was much more amusing
than any shop-bought game. Veronica would laugh over him, and invent
long conversations in which he said such silly things! But when the
evening crept on, and the fire crackled in the grate, and flickered on
the walls, it made it all so different. Why do things which aren’t true
make you think they are true, at night?

Veronica remembered uneasily a curious dream. She was no longer a big
girl with short hair and long thin legs; she was a green velvet
pin-cushion, and pins of various sizes and colours were just about to be
stuck into her before she was sent off to a village bazaar. Though that
was only a dream, for a long time she never saw a pin-cushion without
thinking of herself as one....

And now, to-night, she at last lay back in bed out of sight of the fire,
and tried to plan adventures for the next day. Why did real adventures
always pass her by?

Suddenly she heard a curious low rumbling sound. For a moment she hoped
and yet dreaded that it came from the direction of the chimney, but when
the sound got louder, as it did very soon, she burst out laughing, for
it was only Teddy snoring. The door between their rooms was open, so no
wonder she heard him. How funny, and how disappointing!

In time Veronica’s eyes closed without her noticing it, and lying there,
so comfortable and so warm in bed, just on that borderland of the
ordinary world of lessons and rice pudding (when one expected something
else with jam on it) and that other delicious world of dreams and vague
sensations.

But all at once Veronica heard a great clatter. She sat up in bed and
opened her eyes wide to see in the firelight a most curious little
person. He had leapt out of the chimney and dropped all the fire-irons
in a heap at his feet. She could see them lying there on the white
woolly mat, all at sixes and sevens.

He was very small, about as high as the poker. He had large round eyes,
nearly as round as two pennies. And on his head, perched on the very
top, was the lid of the nursery kettle! It was a copper kettle, and was
always kept very bright.

The stranger was dressed in black and his clothes fitted him quite
tight, like a well-drawn-up stocking or a glove.

Veronica gazed at him, her eyes growing almost as round as his own.

Then he stamped his foot, and raising his arms over his head, he made a
low bow.

“Madam, your wish to see me, though it is only prompted by idle
curiosity, has brought me down from my kingdom among the chimney pots. I
have a request to make to you. Will you take my place for a few hours? I
am called away on urgent private affairs, but I cannot leave my work up
there unless you will give me your help.”

His voice was high and sharp. It was rather like listening to a sparrow.

[Illustration: “HE MADE A LOW BOW”]

He went straight on, without waiting for an answer. “It is a mistake to
suppose that I live in the chimney. It would be most disagreeable to do
so, as I should have thought you, who have imagination, would realize.
But I am talking too much. I wait respectfully, Madam, for your answer.
Will you help me?”

Veronica wriggled uncomfortably under the warm bedclothes.

“I will help you if I can.” She was a cautious, as well as a truthful,
child, so she added hastily, “I don’t want to say I will, if I can’t.
And are you—_are_ you Mr. Snoogles?”

The strange little man standing on the mat threw back his head so
suddenly that the lid of the kettle fell off and bounced away behind the
coal scuttle.

“Oh, how funny!” he laughed. “I shall add that to my collection. No, I’m
_not_ Mr. Snoogles; but I am the person whom your brother calls Mr.
Snoogles.”

“So Teddy _has_ seen you after all. Sometimes I thought Mr. Snoogles was
only a game.”

“Indeed, I’m not a game. What a horrid thing to be! Imagine being a
football?”

“Or a pin-cushion,” said Veronica hastily. “I know because I believed I
was one once, but only for a short time,” she added, because she was
truthful, but also in case Mr. Snoogles found a stray pin on the floor
and, remembering what she had said, might stick it into her. He looked
such a tidy man.

“I can assure you, Madam, that I will not request you to do anything at
all difficult. I shall only require your services for a short period—say
about ten years.”

“_Ten years?_ But in ten years I shall be quite old—that is, quite grown
up. I shall be twenty-one.”

“Well, what of that? My work is much more amusing than what you do all
day—lessons, walks, quarrels.”

Veronica felt a little taken aback.

“But I don’t quarrel—that is to say, not much, not nearly as much as do
our cousins in the country or as the long-haired family we see in the
park. Would you like to hear my names? I am not madam yet. You see, I am
not married. And won’t you sit down?”

“No, I never sit down. It’s lazy. Proceed with your names. Though I know
what I call you to myself.”

“I was christened Elizabeth Veronica Sybella—now, what do _you_ call
me?”

“Never mind. Don’t ask questions. It’s bad manners.”

Veronica felt annoyed, but she put her pride in her pocket and asked:
“If I do what you want me to do—will you tell me then?”

“I shall if you deserve it.”

What a horrid thing to say! How like a holiday governess!—the sort that
Veronica and her brother had had last summer.

“We must be gone. You have been wasting _our_ time. Not that time is
money to me.”

“Isn’t it? It is to father, though how he makes it into money I don’t
know. I have so much time I could make such a lot of money if only I
knew how to do it.”

“Money is silly stuff. Look how easily it burns. Only yesterday I saw
the kitchenmaid at No. 5 throw a five-pound note on to the fire. She
didn’t know what it was, poor silly girl, though she is very clever at
washing cups and saucers. Come on now!”

Veronica jumped out of bed, and ran over to the fireplace.

“Do we go up there?” she said, looking at the chimney and then at the
dying fire. “Won’t it burn?”

“Not when you are with me. Fire is my servant. I am fire’s lord and
master. But if you feel at all nervous I will command it to die.”

With these dramatic words Mr. Snoogles clapped his hands together and
cried out: “Servant, hide thyself! Let thy light burn dim while we pass
over you.”

Instantly the coals grew grey and dusty.

Mr. Snoogles put out his hand, and taking Veronica’s fingers firmly in
his, he pulled her up, and soon she found herself being drawn up higher
and higher.

“When we get to the top I will explain what you have to do.”

Veronica said nothing. Adventure had come at last—the real thing, better
than any story-book she had ever read, because it was happening to
her—actually to her.

They suddenly came out into the night air. To the right, to the left, in
fact, wherever she looked, were chimney pots. Some had strange things on
them like hats.

Then it was that Veronica noticed she had become about the same size as
Mr. Snoogles. She did not feel cold, either, which was stranger still.
But she sat down as she had been told, and gazed about her. High above,
the stars were twinkling and the young moon was shining.

Mr. Snoogles coughed.

“Have you finished thinking your thoughts, and will you now think of
mine?” he said crossly.

“I am so sorry. Please tell me yours.”

“My business—and soon it will be _your_ business, don’t forget—is to be
the Watchman of Fire and Smoke. Smoke is used for punishment because it
is unpleasant. But Fire brings warmth and happiness. You will have power
over them both, but you must keep Fire in his proper place. When you see
things not going well in a house then send down Smoke. If they bear it
well, and cease to think of themselves, call it back and ask Fire to
burn brightly to warm them, and to make them feel happy and cheerful. If
a live coal flies out on the mat, you must be there to make it go out. A
house on fire is a terrible thing, and means you have not been doing
your work properly.” He waited a moment, then exclaimed: “I must be
going soon, so do your best!”

[Illustration: “HAVE YOU FINISHED THINKING YOUR THOUGHTS”]

“But how shall I——?” Veronica looked round, but Mr. Snoogles had
vanished, and she found herself alone on the roof.

“I can’t do it, it’s too difficult,” she said to herself, “much more
difficult than learning a long speech out of Shakespeare. One can always
do that if one really tries, but this——?”

                  *       *       *       *       *

“Veronica, Veronica, I have been screaming at you for ages. There is a
big fire outside! That empty house is burning down, I can see it from my
window——”

Teddy was jumping about in his pyjamas. “Come along! Hurry up!” he
shouted.

Veronica got out of bed as if she was dreaming. Then she cried in great
distress, “It’s my fault—that fire. Mr. Snoogles said I must not allow
it to happen.”

“Don’t be so silly. Mr. Snoogles isn’t real. Come along!”

The two children ran to the window, and in the excitement of watching
the fire engines arrive, and the water pouring out of the great hose
pipes Veronica forgot her part in this tragedy.

Later in the morning, as they were coming in from a walk, Veronica said,
“Teddy, what was Mr. Snoogles really like when you saw him? Do tell me
and I will tell you a great secret.”

“Mr. Snoogles? I will show him to you.”

Teddy took off his coat and hat, and running halfway up the stairs, he
threw his coat round a pillar which marked the half landing. Then he put
his cap on the round knot at the top.

“Veronica! Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Snoogles!”

“Teddy! D’you mean you never saw him really? I have.”

“Of course I didn’t. And you haven’t either!”

Veronica said nothing to that. She knew better.

                                                         HERBERT ASQUITH


                 Bob has blown a hundred eggs,
                     Blue and olive, white and grey;
                 Warbler, nightingale, and thrush,
                   Bob has blown their songs away!

                 Low in spotless wool they rest,
                     Purest blue and clouded white,
                 Streaked with cinnamon and red,
                     Flecked with purples of the night;

                 Mute and gleaming, row on row,
                     Lie the tombstones of the spring!
                 What a chorus would there be
                     If those eggs began to sing!




                            The Two Sailors

[Illustration]

                                                                JOHN LEA


                             _This was one_

           There once was a sailor who never could bear
           To rub any oil on the top of his hair,
           And no one who loved him at sea or at home
           Would offer the use of a brush and a comb.
           He said (and what reason for doubting the tale?)
           The very best brush is the breath of a gale,
           While as to the comb—seek a better, in vain,
           Than jolly good torrents of tropical rain.
           So all round the world (and no cruise did he miss)
           That singular sailor looked something like _this_.


                        _This was the other one_

[Illustration]

         There once was a sailor who lavished with care
         Whole buckets of oil on the top of his hair,
         And no one who loved him omitted to speak
         In rapture of tresses so splendidly sleek.
         He said (and who questions what mariners say?)
         He brushed them and combed them each hour of the day.
         For, up on the mast in the wildest of seas,
         He never neglected such duties as these.
         And so, as no chance he would lazily miss,
         That singular sailor looked something like _this_.




               Doctor Dolittle meets a Londoner in Paris

                                                            HUGH LOFTING


One day John Dolittle was walking alone in the Tuileries Gardens. He had
been asked to come to France by some French naturalists who wished to
consult him on certain new features to be added to the zoo in the Jardin
des Plantes. The Doctor knew Paris well and loved it. To his way of
thinking it was the perfect city—or would be, if it were not so
difficult to get a bath there.

It had been raining all day, but now the sun was shining, and the
gardens, fresh and wet, looked very beautiful. As the Doctor passed one
of the many shrubberies he came upon a sparrow wallowing in a puddle in
the middle of the gravel path.

“Why, I declare!” he muttered to himself, hurrying forward. “It’s
Cheapside!”

The small bird, evidently quite accustomed to human traffic, was far too
busy with his bathing to notice anyone’s approach.

“How do you do, Cheapside?” said the Doctor in sparrow language. “Who on
earth would ever have thought of finding you here?”

The sparrow stopped his fluttering and wallowing and looked up through
the water that ran down in big drops off his tousled head-feathers.

“Jiminy Crickets!” he exclaimed. “It’s the Doc himself!”

[Illustration: “‘HOW DO YOU DO, CHEAPSIDE?’ SAID THE DOCTOR IN SPARROW
LANGUAGE”]

“How do you come to be in Paris?” asked John Dolittle.

“Oh, it’s all Becky’s doing,” grumbled Cheapside, hopping out of the
puddle and fluttering his wings to dry them. “I’m satisfied to stay in
London, goodness knows. But every Spring it’s the same way: ‘Let’s take
a hop over to the Continong,’ says she. ‘The horse-chestnuts will just
be budding.’ ‘We got horse-chestnut trees in Regent’s Park,’ I says to
’er. ‘Ah,’ says she, ‘but not like the ones in the Twiddle-didee
Gardens. Oh, I love Paris in the Spring,’ she says.... It’s always the
same way: every year she drags me over ’ere. Sentiment, I reckon it is.
You see, Doc, me and Becky met one another first ’ere—right ’ere in the
Twiddle-didee Gardens. I recognised ’er as a London Sparrow—you can tell
’em the world over—and we got talkin’. You know the way those things
’appen. She wanted to build our first nest up there in the Lufer Palace.
But I says, ‘No,’ hemphatic. ‘Let’s go back to St. Paul’s,’ I says. ‘I
know a place in St. Edmund’s left ear what ’as all the stonework in
Paris beat ’ollow as a nestin’ place. Besides,’ I says, ‘we don’t want
our children growing up talkin’ no foreign language! We’re Londoners,’ I
says: ‘let’s go back to London.’”

“Yes,” said the Doctor. “Even I guessed you were a London sparrow,
before I recognised you, because——”

“Because I was washin’,” Cheapside finished. “That’s true: these ’ere
foreign birds don’t run to water much.”

“That’s a fine puddle you have there,” said the Doctor. “I’ve half a
mind to ask you to lend it to me. You know, I’ve been trying to get a
bath myself ever since I’ve been in Paris—without success so far. After
all, even a puddle is better than nothing. When I asked them at the
_pension_ where I’m staying could I have a bath, they seemed to think I
was asking for the moon.”

“Oh, I can tell you where you can get a bath, Doctor, a good one,” said
the sparrow. “Just the other side of that shrubbery over there there’s
an elegant marble pond, with a fountain and statues in the middle. You
can hang your bath-towel on the statue and use the fountain for a
shampoo. Just helegant!—But of course you’d have to do it after dark.
Anybody washin’ in Paris is liable to get arrested—not because you ’ad
no clothes on, mind you. Oh no, the French is very sensible about that.
Look at all these statues: they don’t wear no clothes—and in summertime
it’s much cooler for ’em. But washin’? That’s another matter. Over ’ere
they’re very suspicious of anybody washin’. Just the same you could
manage a tub in the marble pond late at night, easy—because there’s
hardly anybody in the gardens then.”

“My gracious! I’ve a good mind to try it, Cheapside,” said the Doctor.
“I haven’t had a bath in over a week.”

“Well,” said the Cockney sparrow, “you meet me here at midnight and me
and Becky will guide you to the pond and keep a look-out while you get a
wash.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

There was a half moon that night. And when, a few minutes before twelve
o’clock, John Dolittle came into the Tuileries Gardens with a bath-towel
over his arm, the first person he saw was a French policeman. Not
wishing to be taken for a suspicious character, he thrust the bath-towel
beneath his coat and hurried past the shrubbery as though bent on
important business.

But he had not gone very far before he was overtaken by Cheapside and
his wife, Becky.

“Don’t get worried, Doc, don’t get worried,” said the sparrow. “That
bobby only goes by about once every ’alf-hour. ’E won’t be back for a
while. Come over ’ere and we’ll show you your dressing-room.”

John Dolittle was thereupon conducted to a snug retreat in the heart of
a big shrubbery.

“Nobody can see you ’ere,” said Cheapside. “And as soon as you’re ready
all you’ve got to do is to ’op round that privet-’edge, sprint across
the little lawn and there’s your bath waitin’ for you. Me and Becky will
keep a look-out. And if any danger comes along we’ll whistle.”

Five minutes later the famous naturalist was wallowing luxuriously in
the marble pond. The night was softly brilliant with moonlight, and the
statues in the centre of the pool stood out palely against the dark mass
of the trees behind.

John Dolittle had paused a moment with a cake of soap uplifted in his
hand, utterly enchanted by the beauty of the scene, when he heard
Cheapside hoarsely whispering to him from a branch overhead.

“Look out! Hide quick! Someone coming!”

Now the Doctor had left his bath-towel on the base of the statue. At
Cheapside’s warning he splashed wildly out to get it before attempting a
retreat to the shrubbery. Breathless, he finally reached the fountain.
But just as he was about to grasp the towel Becky called from the other
side of the pond:

“Cheapside! There is another party coming in at the other gate! The
Doctor can never make it in time.”

John Dolittle, waist-deep in the water at the foot of the statue, looked
about him in despair.

“Gracious! What shall I do then?” he cried drawing the bath-towel over
his shoulders.

“You’ll have to be a statue,” hissed Cheapside the quick thinker. “Hop
up on to the pedestal. They’ll never know the difference in this light.
When they go by you can come down. Hurry! They’re quite close. I can see
their heads over the top of the hedge.”

Swiftly winding his bath-towel about him, John Dolittle sprang up on to
the pedestal and crouched in a statuesque pose. The marble group was of
Neptune the sea-god and several attendant figures. John Dolittle, M.D.,
became one of the attendant figures. His hand raised to shade his eyes
from an imaginary sun, he gazed seaward with a stony stare.

“Fine!” whispered Cheapside, flying on to the base of the statue. “No
one could tell you from the real thing. Just keep still and you’ll be
all right. They won’t stay, I don’t expect. Here they come. Don’t get
nervous, now. Bless me, I believe they’re English too!—Tourists. Well,
did you ever?”

A man and a woman, strolling through the gardens by one of the many
crossing paths, had now paused at the edge of the pond and, to John
Dolittle’s horror, were gazing up at the statue in the centre of it.
They were both elderly; they both carried umbrellas; and they both wore
spectacles.

“I’ll bet they’re short-sighted, Doc,” whispered Cheapside comfortingly.
“Don’t worry.”

“Dear me, Sarah,” sighed the man. “What a beautiful night! The moon and
the trees and the fountain. And such an imposing statue!—The sea-god
Neptune with his mermaids and mermen.”

“Lancelot,” said the woman shortly, “let us hurry home. You’ll get your
bronchitis worse in this damp air. I don’t like the statue at all. I
never saw such fat creatures. Just look at that one on the corner
there—the one with his hand up scanning the horizon. Why, he’s stouter
than the butcher at home!”

“Humph!” muttered Cheapside beneath his breath. “It don’t seem to me as
though _you_ ’ave any figure to write ’ome about, Mrs. Scarecrow.”

At this moment a large flying beetle landed on the Doctor’s neck and
nearly spoiled everything.

“Good gracious, Sarah!” cried the man. “I thought I saw one of the
figures move, the fat one.”

The tourist adjusted his spectacles and, coming a little closer to the
edge of the pond, stared very hard. But Cheapside, to add a touch of
convincing realism, flew up on to the merman’s shoulder, kicked the
beetle into the pond with a secret flick of his foot and burst into a
flood of carefree song.

“No, Sarah,” said the man. “I was mistaken. See, there is a bird sitting
on his shoulder. How romantic! Must be a nightingale.”

“_Will_ you come home, Lancelot?” snapped the woman. “You won’t feel so
romantic when your cough comes back. It must be after midnight.”

“But you know, Sarah,” said the man, as he was almost forcibly dragged
away, “_I_ don’t think he’s too fat. They had to be stout, those marine
people: they floated better that way. Dear me, Paris is a beautiful
city!”

As the footsteps died away down the moonlit path, John Dolittle sighed a
great sigh of relief and came to life.

“Cheapside,” said he, stretching his stiff arms, “you could never guess
who those people were. My sister Sarah and her husband, the Reverend
Lancelot Dingle. It’s funny, Cheapside, but whenever I am in an awkward
or ridiculous situation Sarah seems bound to turn up. Of course she and
her husband would just _have_ to come touring Paris at the exact hour
when I was taking a bath in the Tuileries Gardens. Ah well, thank
goodness the pond kept them off from getting any closer to me!”

“Well, listen, Doc,” said the London sparrow: “I think you had better be
gettin’ along yourself now. It’s about time for that bobby to be coming
round again.”

“Yes, you’re right,” said the Doctor. And he slid back into the water,
waded to the edge and stepped out on to dry ground.

But John Dolittle’s troubles were not over yet. While he was still no
more than half way to his “dressing-room” there came another warning
shout from Cheapside:

“Look out!—Here he comes!”

This time flight seemed the only course. The policeman had seen the
culprit disappear into the shrubbery. Breaking into a run, he gave
chase.

“Don’t stop, Doc!” cried Cheapside. “Grab your clothes and get out the
other side—Becky! Hey, Becky! Keep that policeman busy a minute.”

The Doctor did as he was told. Seizing his clothes in a pile as he
rushed through the shrubbery, he came out at the other end like an
express train emerging from a tunnel. Here Cheapside met him and led him
across a lawn to another group of bushes. Behind this he hurriedly got
into his clothes. Meanwhile Becky kept the policeman busy by furiously
pecking him in the neck and making it necessary for him to stop and beat
her off.

However, she could not of course keep this up for long. And if John
Dolittle had not been an exceptionally quick dresser he could never have
got away. In one minute and a quarter, collar and tie in one hand, soap
and towel in the other, he left his second dressing-room on the run and
sped for the gate and home.

The loyal Cheapside was still with him; but the sparrow was now so
convulsed with laughter that he could scarcely keep up, even flying.

“I don’t see what you find so funny about it,” panted the Doctor
peevishly as he slowed down at the gate and began putting on his collar.
“I had a very narrow escape from getting arrested.”

“Yes, and you’d have gone to jail, too,” gasped Cheapside. “It’s no
light offence, washing in this country. But that wasn’t what I was
laughing at.”

“Well, what was it, then?” asked the Doctor, feeling for a stud in his
pocket.

“The Reverend Dingle took me for a nightingale!” tittered the Cockney
sparrow. “I must go back and tell Becky that. So long, Doc! You’ll be
all right now. That bobby’s lost you altogether.... After all, you got
your bath. See you in Puddleby next month.”

                 If buttercups were white and pink,
                     And roses green and blue,
                 Then you instead of me could think,
                     And I instead of you.

                 Then I could daily give your doll
                     Her early evening tub,
                 While you in easy-chairs could loll
                     At some or other Club.

                 Then I could spell p-i-g pidge,
                     And learn to sew like Nurse;
                 While you could take a hand at bridge,
                     And murmur “Zooks!” or worse.

                 Oh, it would be as fresh a sight
                     As ever yet was seen,
                 If buttercups were pink and white
                     And roses blue and green.

                            MARGARET KENNEDY


              I sat beside the ingle-nook,
                  The fire was glowing;
              The pot was bubbling on the hook,
                  The wind was blowing.
              In the shadows of the room
                  Ghosts were hiding;
              From the furthest, deepest gloom
                  They came gliding.
              At the back of me I knew
                  Crowds were creeping.
              Through the house the storm-wind blew,
                  Flames went leaping,
              Awful shadows on the wall
                  Set me screaming.
              Close at hand came Someone’s call:
                  “Sure she’s dreaming!
                  What have you seen?
                      Kitteen!
              Tell us, what have you seen?”

              In the brown bog by the lake
                  There are stacks of drying peat;
              When by chance that way I take,
                  Past I run with flying feet;
              For once when, wandering carelessly,
                  I came into that lonely place,
              I watched a peat stack close to me
                  And saw it had a wrinkled face!
              All old women sitting round,
                  Each one in a long brown cloak;
              They gazed and gazed upon the ground
                  With eyes like stones, and never spoke.
              Then I turned my back and fled
                  Up our hill, with stumbling feet;
              In a doorway Someone said:
                  “She’s as white as any sheet!
                  What did you see?
                    Kitteen machree!
              Tell us, what did you see?”




                                Gilbert

                                                           CLEMENCE DANE


I am the aunt of Annabel. Annabel is coming next Friday to the birthday
party she ought to have had a month ago; but she had measles instead. I
am anxious for Annabel to enjoy herself. Whom shall I ask to meet her?

Annabel is five—a gracious-mannered five, with a smooth bobbed head of
red hair, eyes like lilacs, and a generously curved mouth. She is a
darling. She is also a devil. She never allows me or anyone else a quiet
moment with her mother when she is in the room: indeed, she owns her
parents and regards all visitors as her perquisites. She owns also, and
can use with disastrous effect on my borders, a scooter and a tricycle.
She can adjust the wireless set and listen in at her pleasure to
Bournemouth, Cardiff or London. She swears at the dog in broad Devon,
and has her ideas about her frocks. But she cannot read or tie her own
shoes or tell the time.

Annabel is coming to tea on Friday. How am I to keep her amused? Shall I
invite Philip Collins, that hard-working child, proprietor of
stickle-backs, my particular friend? Will there be anything left of
Philip if I do—or of Annabel? Philip is seven. With only a year or so
between them they ought to get on. And yet, how did I feel towards seven
when I was five? Across the white magic-lantern circle of my memory a
shadow flits, a leggy, olive-green shadow, with fur at its neck and
wrists, and I recognise Gilbert, and pause.

Annabel is so much more sophisticated and so much more of a baby than we
were ever allowed to be, that the Gilbert adventure could hardly happen
to her. She would say she didn’t like him and be done with it. And
yet—suppose she didn’t! Suppose she suffered him in silence like her
aunt before her! I do want Annabel to enjoy herself.

[Illustration: “SHE OWNS ALSO, AND CAN USE WITH DISASTROUS EFFECT ON MY
BORDERS, A SCOOTER AND A TRICYCLE.”]

You must not think that there was any harm in Gilbert. He was, I see
now, a nice, polite little boy. My Aunt Angela said so. He was as nice a
boy, I daresay, as Philip, who is—perhaps—to make Annabel’s acquaintance
next Friday. But he was long and, as it was a fancy-dress ball, his
mother had dressed him in greenery-yallery tights, and a doublet with
moleskin at the neck and wrists. Now, when you are no older than Annabel
and own a live mole which you keep in the ring-dove’s cage, you do not
feel friendly to people who wear moleskin. (No, I don’t know what
happened to the ring-dove, though I remember that she lived for some
time in the kitchen in a straw-coloured wicker-work cage, and was
incessantly laying eggs that wouldn’t hatch and croo-rooing over them in
a lamentable voice which made the nursery feel that the whole bitter
business was the nursery’s fault.)

It is not too much to say that from the moment I set eyes upon Gilbert I
felt for him that unreasoning sick dislike of which only a child is
capable, and which it never attempts to explain. I never said a word to
my Aunt Angela about Gilbert, though I noted him with a prophetic
shudder as I followed her across the shining, slippery floor. Indeed,
nobody could help noticing Gilbert. It was not only that he was so much
longer than anybody else, so prominent among the Joan of Arcs and
Pierrots and Geishas, but that he was such a pervasive dancer: he seemed
to be behaving beautifully with everybody at once. There was a horrible
fascination in his smiling efficiency: he wasn’t shy like everyone else:
he didn’t mind what he did: and he did it well. He was a handsome boy
too, for my Aunt Angela said so. Indeed, I can best fix him for you by
recalling the fact that when I saw Lewis Waller come upon the stage as
Robin Hood I instantly, and for the first time in fifteen years,
remembered Gilbert.

Before I could pull on my white silk mittens, my aunt (I knew she would)
had caught Gilbert and introduced him to me, and he wrote his name on my
programme and his own, and his moleskin wrist—his mole must have been an
older and oilier mole than mine—rubbed against my bare hand. In the
frantic subsequent attempts to scrub off the feel, I spilled water down
my new frock, my fancy-dress of yellow satin petals over a green satin
skirt, with three green satin leaves dangling from the neck; for I, in
that hour, was a primrose.

But washing my hands and drying my frock only took up a dance and a
half: Gilbert and his Berlin Polka were still to be faced.

I had an idea. I would anticipate Gilbert: I would have a partner of my
own. I marked one down, a rosy, bewildered little girl in sparkles: a
Snow-white—a Fairy queen—what did I care? I gave her her orders; for she
was only four. She was to look out for me when number seven began. She
was to refuse to dance with anyone else. She was dancing the Berlin
polka with me—did she understand?—with me: and if a green boy with
moleskin on his wrists asked her where I was, well—there I wasn’t! Did
she quite understand?

I was still passionately explaining the situation when the music of
number six struck up, and her partner, a Father Christmas smaller than
herself, jogged her away. I can still see so clearly the bunchy little
figure—we were not so particular about the cut of our clothes as is
Annabel’s generation—and the alarmed dark eyes and hot cheeks as she
looked back at me over her winged shoulder. As for me, I had to put in
the perilous time somehow. I hid.

I found a beautiful place to hide in, a room with cane chairs and palms,
and one or two screened recesses with two chairs and a table in each. I
sat me down in the only empty recess and listened to the music, and
wondered whether Gilbert had begun to look for me yet. Soon a young lady
with bare shoulders and a young gentleman with an eye-glass arrived,
looked in, departed, and shortly returned again. It was quite evident
that they wanted my refuge. I wasn’t going to let them have it. I was
terrified of them both, but I was still more terrified of Gilbert.

Said the young gentleman:

“What are you doing here?” and he called me “little girl!”

Said I, firmly, but I was on the edge of tears:

“I am waiting for my partner,” and felt that I lied, for I was not
exactly waiting for Gilbert.

[Illustration: “HE STARED AT ME REPROACHFULLY”]

“Oh, indeed!” said the young gentleman, and stared again, and whispered
to the young lady with the white shoulders, and the young lady whispered
back. You cannot think how miserable I felt. They went away at last; but
they, and my lie—a lie was a lie in those days—had ruined my haven. I
slipped out as the music stopped, and instantly the young gentleman and
the young lady got up from two chairs under a palm and sat down behind
my screen, while—oh horror!—Gilbert’s green and questing length crossed
and re-crossed the lighted swirling space on the other side of the
draped doorway. I knew—who better?—whom he sought. I backed into the
dark corner formed by the wall and the other side of the screen, too
much occupied with Gilbert’s next move to attend to the murmurs on the
other side of it. But the sitters-out were sensitive; or I, effacing
myself as much as possible, must have pushed against the screen. Slowly,
over the top, rose the head of the young gentleman. He stared down at me
reproachfully and I, in a paralysis of embarrassment, stared up at him.
You cannot think how tall the screen seemed, and how terrible the face
of the young gentleman to the eyes of five. Nothing was said. How long
he was prepared to stare at me I do not know, for his eye-glass was more
than I could bear: at that moment even Gilbert was easier to face. I
sidled back into the ballroom, worming my way as self-effacingly as
possible in and out between mothers and empty chairs, till a familiar
glitter caught my eye. It was my partner, my illegal partner, so soft,
so rosy, so cosy, so blessedly harmless, so very much smaller than I.
She was not pleased to see me (I realise now that I must have been as
awful to her as Gilbert to me) but what did that matter? I grasped her
hurriedly by a hand and a wing:

“One, two, three,” I prompted: and we put our feet into the second
position. But fate was looking after the little girl in sparkles, not
after me.

“My dance, I think.” Gilbert, cool, easy, adequate, even remembered to
bow. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere!” he said and he put out
mole-skinny hands.

“I’m dancing with _her_,” I muttered. It was my last throw. But at that
a new voice interposed:

“Oh, Mary, you mustn’t take the little girl away from her partner!” And
the fairy queen, inexpressible relief in her eyes, pulled her hand out
of mine and retired upon her mother.

I danced with Gilbert.

The last straw was hearing my Aunt Angela telling my mother, in the cab
coming home, that it was pretty to see how the child had enjoyed
herself.

Now I wonder how Annabel would have dealt with Gilbert? Her childhood is
not my childhood. I read _Pickwick_ at five, while Annabel is satisfied
with _Teddy Tail_: that fancy-dress ball was my first party, while
Annabel goes to dances twice a week. Annabel’s emotions could never have
been in the least like mine. And yet, five years old in the
eighteen-nineties is nearer five years old in the nineteen-twenties than
five years old will ever be to a contemporary aunt. If I ask my nice
Philip Collins to tea—such a handsome boy!—such good manners!—how am I
to be certain that I am not inflicting a Gilbert upon Annabel? On the
other hand, Annabel might have liked Gilbert. He was a popular person
that evening: and Annabel has never kept moles.

Annabel does not think me young. She asked me yesterday if I had ever
spoken to Queen Elizabeth; but she likes to hear what I did in that
Palæolithic age when I was little. I will tell her about Gilbert when I
tuck her up to-night, and see what she says.

              Jack had a little pony, Tom.
              He frequently would take it from
              The stable where it used to stand
              And give it sugar with his hand.
              He also gave it oats and hay
              And carrots twenty times a day
              And grass in basketfuls and greens
              And swedes and mangels: also beans;
              And patent foods from various sources
              And bread—which isn’t good for horses—
              And chocolate and apple-rings,
              And lots and lots of other things
              The most of which do not agree
              With Polo Ponies such as he,
              And all in such a quantity
              As ruined his digestion wholly
              And turned him from a Pono Poly
              —I mean a Polo Pony—into
              A case that clearly must be seen to,
              Because he swelled and swelled and swelled.
              Which, when the kindly boy beheld,
              He gave it medicine by the pail
              In malted milk, and nutmeg ale,
              And yet it only swelled the more
              Until its stomach touched the floor;
              And then it heaved and groaned as well
              And staggered, till at last it fell
              And found it could not rise again.
              Jack wept and prayed—but all in vain.
              The pony died, and, as it died,
              Kicked him severely in the side.

               Tom had a little pony, Jack:
               He vaulted lightly on its back
               And galloped off for miles and miles,
               A-leaping hedges, gates and stiles,
               And shouting “Yoicks!” and “Tally-Ho!”
               And “Heads I win!” and “Tails below!”
               And many another sporting phrase.
               He rode like this for several days,
               Until the pony, feeling tired,
               Collapsed, looked heavenward and expired.
               His father made a fearful row.
               He said, “By Gum! You’ve done it now!
               Here lies, a Carcase on the ground,
               No less than five and twenty pound!
               Indeed, the value of the beast
               Would probably have much increased.
               His teeth were false; and all were told
               That he was only four years old.
               Oh! Curse it all! I tell you plain
               I’ll never let you ride again.”

                 His father died when he was twenty,

How such an odd and curious notion had ever come into Miss Rawlings’s
mind, not even Miss Rawlings herself could have said. When had it come?
She could not answer even that question either. It had simply stolen in
little by little like a beam of sunshine into a large room.

Not of course into an empty room, for Miss Rawlings had many things to
think about. She was by far the most important person in the Parish, and
everyone—from Archdeacon Tomlington and his two curates, Mr. Moffat and
Mr. Timbs, down to little old Mrs. Ort the hump-backed charwoman who
lived in the top attic of a cottage down by Clopbourne—or, as they
called it, Clobburne—Bridge, everyone knew how _practical_ she was.

But once that sunny beam had begun to steal into Miss Rawlings’s mind
and into her life, it had lightened up with its precious gold everything
that was there. It was nevertheless a fantastic notion, simply because
it could not possibly be true. How could Miss Rawlings ever have lost a
little girl if there had never been any little girl to lose? Yet that
exactly was Miss Rawlings’s idea. It had flitted into her imagination
like a nimble, bright-feathered bird. And once it was really there, she
never hesitated to talk about it; not at all.

“My little girl, you know,” she would say with a little emphatic nod and
a pleasant smile on her broad face. Or rather, “My little gal”—for she
always pronounced the word as if it rhymed with Sal—the short for Sarah.
This, too, was an odd thing; for Miss Rawlings had been brought up by
her parents with the very best education, and seldom mispronounced even
such words as Chloe or Psyche or epitome or misled. And so far as I
know—which is not very far—and apart from shall and pal and Hal, there
is not a single word of one syllable in our enormous English language
that is pronounced like Sal; for Pall Mall, of course, is pronounced
Pell Mell. Still, Miss Rawlings did talk about her little girl, and she
called her, her little gal.

It never occurred to anybody in the Parish—not even to Mr. Timbs—to
compare the Little Gal to a gay little bird or to a beam of sunshine.
Mrs. Tomlington said indeed that it was merely a bee in Miss Rawlings’s
bonnet. But whether or not, partly because she delighted in bright
colours, and partly because, in fashion or out, she had entirely her own
taste in dress, there could not be a larger or brighter or flowerier
bonnet for any bee to be _in_. Apart from puce silk and maroon velvet
and heliotrope feathers and ribbons and pom-poms and suchlike, Miss
Rawlings’s bonnets invariably consisted of handsome spreading
flowers—blue-red roses, purple pansies, mauve cineraria—a complete
little garden for any bee’s amusement. And this bee sang rather than
buzzed in it the whole day long.

You might almost say it had made a new woman of her. Miss Rawlings had
always been active and positive and good-humoured and kind. But now her
spirits were so much more animated. She went bobbing and floating
through the Parish like a balloon. Her _interest_ in everything seemed
to have first been multiplied by nine, and then by nine again. And
eighty-one times anything is a pretty large quantity. Beggars, gipsies,
hawkers, crossing-sweepers, blind men positively smacked their lips when
they saw Miss Rawlings come sailing down the street. Her heart was like
the Atlantic, and they like row-boats on the deep—especially the blind
men. As for her donations to the Parochial Funds, they were first
doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled.

There was, first, for example, the Fund for giving all the little
parish girls and boys not only a bun and an orange and a tree at
Christmas and a picnic with Veal and Ham Pie and Ice Pudding in
June, but a Jack-in-the-Green on May-day and a huge Guy on
November the 5th, with Squibs and Roman Candles and Chinese
Crackers and so on. There was not only the Fund for the Delight of
Infants of Every Conceivable Description; there was also the
Wooden-Legged Orphans’ Fund. There was the Home for Manx and Tabby
Cats; and the Garden by the River with the willows for Widowed
Gentlewomen. There was the Threepenny-Bit-with-a-Hole-in-It
Society; and the Organ Grinders’ Sick Monkey and Blanket Fund, and
there was the oak-beamed Supper Room in “The Three Wild Geese” for
the use of Ancient Mariners—haggis and toad-in-the-hole, and plum
duff and jam roley-poley. And there were many others. If Miss
Rawlings had been born in another parish, it would have been a sad
thing indeed for the cats and widows and orphans and organ monkeys
in her own.

With such a power and quantity of money, of course, writing cheques was
very much like just writing in birthday-books. Still you can give too
much to any Fund; though very few people make the attempt. But Miss
Rawlings was a practical woman. Besides, Miss Rawlings knew perfectly
well that charity must at any rate _begin_ at home, so all this time she
was keeping what the Ancient Mariners at the “Three Wild Geese” called a
“weather eye” wide open for her lost Little Gal. But how, it may be
asked, could she keep any kind of an eye open for a lost Little Gal,
when she didn’t know what the lost Little Gal was like? And the answer
to that is that Miss Rawlings knew perfectly well.

She may not have known where the absurd notion came from, or when, or
why; but she knew that. She knew what the Little Gal looked like as well
as a mother thrush knows what an egg looks like; or Sir Christopher Wren
knew what a cathedral looks like. But as with the Thrush and Sir
Christopher, a good many little things had happened to Miss Rawlings
first. And this quite apart from the old wooden doll she used to lug
about when she was seven, called Quatta.

One morning, for example, Miss Rawlings had been out in her carriage and
was thinking of nothing in particular, just daydreaming, when not very
far from the little stone bridge at Clobburne she happened to glance up
at a window in the upper parts of a small old house. And at that window
there seemed to show a face with dark bright eyes watching her. Just a
glimpse. I say _seemed_, for when in the carriage Miss Rawlings rapidly
twisted her head to get a better view, she discovered either that there
had been nobody there at all, or that the somebody had swiftly drawn
back, or that the bright dark eyes were just too close-together flaws in
the diamond-shaped bits of glass. In the last case what Miss Rawlings
had seen was mainly “out of her mind.” But if so, it went back again and
stayed there. It was excessively odd, indeed, how clear a remembrance
that glimpse left behind it.

Then again, Miss Rawlings, like her great-aunt Felicia, had always
enjoyed a weakness for taking naps in the train, the flowers and plumes
and bows in her bonnet nodding the while above her head. The sound of
the wheels on the iron lines was like a lullaby; the fields trailing
softly away beyond the window drowsed her eyes. Whether asleep or not,
she would generally close her eyes and at least appear to be napping.
And not once, or twice, but three separate times, owing to a screech of
the whistle or a jolt of the train, she had suddenly opened them again
to find herself staring out (rather like a large animal in a field) at a
little girl sitting on the opposite seat, who, in turn, had already
fixed _her_ eyes on Miss Rawlings’s countenance. In every case there had
been a look of intense, patient interest on the little girl’s face.

Perhaps Miss Rawlings’s was a countenance that all little girls are apt
to look at with extreme interest—especially when the owner of it is
asleep in the train. It was a broad countenance with a small but
powerful nose with a round tip. There was a good deal of fresh colour in
the flat cheeks beneath the treacle-coloured eyes; and the hair stood
out like a wig beneath the huge bonnet. Miss Rawlings, too, had a habit
of folding her kid-gloved hands upon her lap as if she was an image.
None the less, you could hardly call it only “a coincidence” that these
little girls were so much alike, and so much like the face at the
window. And so very much like the real lost Little Gal that had always,
it seemed, been at the back of Miss Rawlings’s mind.

Not that there had ever been any kind of a ghost in Miss Rawlings’s
family. Her family was far too practical for that; and her mansion was
most richly furnished. All I mean is that each one of these little girls
happened to have a rather narrow face, a brown pigtail, rather small
dark brown bright eyes and narrow hands, and except for the one at the
window, they wore round beaver hats and buttoned coats. No; there was no
ghost _there_. What Miss Rawlings was after was an absolutely real
Little Gal. And her name was Barbara Allan.

This sounds utterly absurd. But so it had come about. For a long
time—having talked about her Little Gal again and again to the
Archdeacon and Mrs. Tomlington and Mr. Moffat and other ladies and
gentlemen in the Parish, Miss Rawlings had had no name at all for her
small friend. But one still summer evening, there being a faint red in
the sky, while she was wandering gently about her immense drawing-room,
she had happened to open a book lying on an “occasional” table. It was a
book of poetry—crimson and gilt-edged, with a brass clasp—and on the
very page under her nose she had read this line:

                   “Fell in love with Barbara Allan.”

The words ran through her mind like wildfire. Barbara Allan—it was _the_
name! Or how very like it! An echo? Certainly some words and names _are_
echoes of one another—sisters or brothers once removed, so to speak.
Tomlington and Pocklingham, for example; or quince and shrimp; or
angelica and cyclamen. All I mean is that the very instant Miss Rawlings
saw that printed “Barbara Allan,” it ran through her heart like an old
tune in a nursery. It _was_ her Little Gal, or ever so near it—as near,
that is, as any name can be to a thing, viz., crocus, or comfit, or
shuttlecock, or mistletoe, or pantry.

Now, if Miss Rawlings had been of royal blood and had lived in a
fairy-tale; if, that is, she had been a Queen in Grimm—it would have
been a quite ordinary thing that she should be seeking a little lost
Princess, or badly in need of one. But except that her paternal
grandfather was a Sir Samuel Rawlings, she was but very remotely
connected with royalty. Still, if you think about it, seeing that once
upon a time there were only marvellous Adam and beautiful Eve in the
Garden, that is in the whole wide world, and seeing that all of Us as
well as all of the earth’s Kings and Queens must have descended from
them, _therefore_ all of Us must have descended from Kings and Queens.
So too with Miss Rawlings. But—unlike Mrs. Tomlington—she had not come
down by the grand staircase.

Since then Miss Rawlings did not live in a fairy-tale nor in Grimm, but
was a very real person in a very real Parish, her friends and
acquaintances were all inclined in private to agree with Mrs. Tomlington
that her Little Gal was nothing but a bee in her bonnet. And that the
longer it stayed there the louder it buzzed. Indeed, Miss Rawlings
almost began to think of nothing else. She became absent-minded, quite
forgetting her soup and fish and chicken and French roll when she sat at
dinner. She left on the gas. She signed cheques for the Funds without
looking back at the counterfoils to see what she had last subscribed.
She gave brand-new mantles and dolmens away to the Rummagers; ordered
coals from her fishmonger’s; rode third class with a first class ticket;
addressed a postcard to Mrs. Tomfoolington—almost every kind of
absent-minded thing you can imagine.

And now she was always searching: even in the house sometimes; even in
the kitchen quarters. And her plump country maids would gladly help too.
“No, m’m, she ain’t here.” “No, m’m, we ain’t a-seed her yet.” “Lor’,
yes’m, the rooms be ready.”

Whenever Miss Rawlings rose from her chair, she would at once peer
sharply out of the window to see if any small creature were passing in
the street beyond the drive. When she went a-walking, she was frequently
all but run over by cabs and vans and phaetons and gigs, because she was
looking the other way after a vanishing pigtail. Not a picture-shop, not
a photographer’s could she pass without examining every single face
exhibited in the window. And she never met a friend, or the friend of a
friend, or conversed with a stranger without, sure enough, beginning to
talk about Young Things. Puppies or kittens or lambs, perhaps, first,
and then gradually on to little boys. And then, with a sudden whisk of
her bonnet, to Little Girls.

Long, long ago now she had learnt by heart the whole of “Barbara Allan”:

             “... She had not gane a mile but twa,
                      When she heard the dead-bell ringing,
                  And every jow that the dead-bell gied,
                      It cryed, _Woe to Barbara Allan!_

                  ‘O mother, mother, make my bed!
                      O make it saft and narrow!
                  Since my love died for me to-day,
                      I’ll die for him to-morrow.’”

Oh dear, how sad it was; and you never knew! Could it be, could it be,
she cried one day to herself, that the dead, lovely Barbara Allan of the
poem had got by some means muddled up in Time, and was in actual fact
_her_ Little Gal? Could it be that the maiden-name of the wife of Miss
Allan’s father had been Rawlings?

Miss Rawlings was far too sensible merely to wonder about things. She at
once enquired of Mr. Moffat (who had been once engaged to her dearest
friend, Miss Simon, now no more) whether he knew anything about Barbara
Allan’s family. “The family, Felicia?” Mr. Moffat had replied, his
bristling eyebrows high in his head. And when, after a visit to the
British Museum, Mr. Moffat returned with only two or three pages of
foolscap closely written over with full particulars of the ballad and
with “biographical details” of Bishop Percy and of Allan Ramsay and of
Oliver Goldsmith and of the gentleman who had found the oldest
manuscript copy of it in Glamis Castle, or some such ancient edifice,
and of how enchantingly Samuel Pepys’s friend, Mrs. Knipp, used to sing
him the air—but nothing else: Miss Rawlings very reluctantly gave up all
certainty of this. “It still might be my Little Gal’s family,” she said,
“and on the other hand it might not.” And she continued to say over to
herself with infinite sorrow in her deep rich voice, that tragic stanza:

                She had not gane a mile but twa,
                  When she heard the dead-bell ringing,
                And every jow that the dead-bell gied,
                  It cryed, _Woe to Barbara Allan!_

And “Oh no! not Woe,” she would say in her heart.

Soon after this, Miss Rawlings fell ill. A day or two before she took to
her bed, she had been walking along Laburnum Avenue, and had happened to
see the pupils of the Miss Miffinses’ Young Ladies’ Seminary taking the
air. Now, the last two and smallest of these pupils—of the Crocodile, as
rude little boys call it—were walking arm in arm with the nice English
mistress, chattering away like birds in a bush. Both of them were rather
narrow little creatures, both wore beaver hats beneath which dangled
brown pigtails. It was yet one more astonishing moment, and Miss
Rawlings had almost broken into a run—as much of a run, that is, as
being of so stout and ample a presence she was capable of—in order to
get a glimpse of their faces.

But, alas! and alack! the wrought-iron gates of the school were just
round the corner of Laburnum Avenue, and the whole Crocodile had
completely disappeared into the great stone porch beyond by the time she
had come in sight of the two Monkey-Puzzles on the lawn, and the brass
curtain bands to the windows.

Miss Rawlings stood and gazed at these—for the moment completely
forgetting polite manners. The hurry and excitement had made her hot and
breathless: and the wind was in the east. It dispirited her, and instead
of ringing the bell and asking for the Miss Miffinses, she had returned
home and had at once written an invitation to the whole school to come
to tea the following Sunday afternoon. In a moment of absent-mindedness,
however, she left the note on her little rose-wood secretaire beside the
silver inkstand that had belonged to Sir Samuel. And two days
afterwards—on the Friday, that is, the month being February—she had been
seized with Bronchitis.

It was a rather more severe attack than was usual for Miss Rawlings,
even in foggy November, and it made Miss Rawlings’s family physician a
little anxious. There was no immediate danger, he explained to Nurse
Murphy; still care is care. And Miss Rawlings, being so rich and so
important to the Parish, he at once decided to invite an eminent
Consultant to visit his patient—a Sir James Jolliboy Geoghehan who lived
in Harley Street and knew more about Bronchitis (Harley Street being
also in a foggy parish) than any other medical man in Europe or in the
United States of America (which are not usually foggy places).

Fortunately, Sir James took quite as bright and sanguine a view of his
patient as did Miss Rawlings’s family physician. There Miss Rawlings
lay, propped up against her beautiful down pillows with the frills all
round, and a fine large pale blue-ribboned bed cap stood up on her large
head. She was breathing pretty fast, and her temperature, according to
both the gentlemen’s thermometers, was 102.6.

A large copper kettle was ejecting clouds of steam from the vast
cheerful fire in the vast brass and steel grate, with the Cupids in the
chimneypiece. There were medicine bottles on the little table and not
only Nurse Murphy stood grave but brave on the other side of the bed,
but, even still more Irish Nurse O’Brien also. Now, the more solemn
_she_ looked the more her face appeared to be creased up in a gentle
grin.

Miss Rawlings panted as she looked at them all. Her eye was a little
absent, but she too was smiling. For if there was one thing Miss
Rawlings was certain to do, it was to be cheerful when most other people
would be inclined to be depressed. As she knew she was ill she felt
bound to be smiling. She even continued to smile when Sir James
murmured, “_And_ the tongue?” And she assured Sir James that though it
was exceedingly kind of him to call it wasn’t in the least necessary. “I
frequently have bronchitis,” she explained, “but I never die.” Which
sounded a little like “rambling.”

When Sir James and the family physician had gone downstairs and were
closeted together in the gilded Library, Sir James at once asked this
question: “What, my dear sir, was our excellent patient remarking about
a Miss Barbara Allan? Has she a relative of the name?”

At this Miss Rawlings’s family physician looked a little confused. “No,
no; oh dear no,” he exclaimed. “It’s merely a little fancy, a caprice.
Miss Rawlings has a notion there is a little girl belonging to her
somewhere—probably of that name, you know. Quite harmless. An
aberration. In fact, I indulge it; I indulge it. Miss Rawlings is a most
able, sagacious, energetic, philanthropic, practical, generous,
and—and—humorous lady. The fancy, you see, has somehow attached itself
to the _name_ Barbara Allan—a heroine, I believe, in one of Sir Walter
Scott’s admirable fictions. Only that. Nothing more.”

Sir James, a tall man, peered down at Miss Rawlings’s family physician
over his gold pince-nez. “I once had a patient, my dear Dr. Sheppard,”
he replied solemnly in a voice a good deal deeper but not so rich as
Miss Rawlings’s, “who had the amiable notion that she was the Queen of
Sheba and that I was King Solomon. A _most_ practical woman. She left me
three hundred guineas in her will, for a mourning ring.” He thereupon
explained (in words that his patient could not possibly have understood,
but that Dr. Sheppard understood perfectly), that Miss Rawlings was in
no immediate danger and that she was indeed quite a comfortable little
distance from Death’s Door. Still, bronchitis _is_ bronchitis; so let
the dear lady be humoured as much as possible. “Let her have the very
best nurses, excellent creatures; and all the comforts.” He smiled as he
said these words, as if Dr. Sheppard was a long-lost brother. And he
entirely approved not only of the nice sago puddings, the grapes, the
delicious beef-juice (with toast _or_ a rusk), the barley water and the
physic, but of as many Barbara Allans as Miss Rawlings could possibly
desire. And all that he said sounded so much like the chorus of “Yeo,
ho, ho,” or “Away to Rio,” or “The Anchor’s Weighed,” that one almost
expected Dr. Sheppard to join in.

Both gentlemen then took their leave, and Dr. Sheppard having escorted
Sir James to his brougham (for this was before the days of machine
carriages), the two nurses retired from the window and Miss Rawlings
sank into a profound nap.

In a few days Miss Rawlings was much, much, much better. Her temperature
was 97.4. Her breathing no more than twenty-four or five to the
minute—at most. The flush had left her cheeks, and she had finished
three whole bottles of medicine. She devoured a slice from the breast of
a chicken and said she enjoyed her sago pudding. The nurses _were_
pleased.

Now, naturally, of course, Miss Rawlings’s illness increased her anxiety
to find Barbara Allan as quickly as ever she could. After all, you see,
we all of us have only a certain number of years to live, and a year
lasts only twelve calendar months, and the shortest month is only
twenty-eight days (excluding Leap Year). So if you want to do anything
badly it is better to begin at once, and go straight on.

The very first day she was out in Mr. Dubbins’s invalid chair she met
her dear friend Mr. Moffat in Combermere Grove, and he stood conversing
with her for a while under the boughs of almost as wide a spreading
chestnut-tree as the village blacksmith’s in the poem. Mr. Moffat always
looked as if he ought to have the comfort of a sleek, bushy beard. If he
had, it is quite certain it would have wagged a good deal as he listened
to Miss Rawlings. “What I am about to do, my dear Mr. Moffat, is
advertise,” she cried, and in such a powerful voice that the lowest
fronds of the leafing chestnut-tree over her head slightly trembled as
they hung a little listlessly on their stalks in the spring sunshine.

“Advertise, my dear Felicia?” cried Mr. Moffat. “And what for?”

“Why, my dear old friend,” replied Miss Rawlings, “for Barbara Allan to
be sure.”

Mr. Moffat blinked very rapidly, and the invisible beard wagged more
than ever. And he looked hard at Miss Rawlings’s immense bonnet as if he
actually expected to see that busy bee; as if he even feared it might be
a Queen Bee and would produce a complete hive.

But after bidding him good-bye with yet another wag of the bonnet and a
“Yes, thank you, Dubbins,” Miss Rawlings was as good as her word. She
always was. Three days afterwards there appeared in the _Times_, and in
the _Morning Post_, and in the _Daily Telegraph_, and five days later,
in the _Spectator_, the following:

    WANTED as soon as possible, by a lady who has lost her as long
    as she can remember, a little girl of the name (probably) of
    Barbara Allan, or of a name that _sounds_ like Barbara Allan.
    The little girl is about ten years old. She has a rather
    three-cornered shaped face, with narrow cheek-bones, and bright
    brown eyes. She is slim, with long fingers, and wears a pigtail
    and probably a round beaver hat. She shall have an _exceedingly_
    happy home and Every Comfort, and her friends (or relatives)
    will be amply rewarded for all the care and kindness they have
    bestowed upon her, for the first nine years or more of her life.

You should have seen Miss Rawlings reading that advertisement over and
over. Her _Times_ that morning had a perfume as of the spices of
Ambrosia. But even Miss Rawlings could not have hoped that her
advertisement would be so rapidly and spontaneously and abundantly
answered. The whole day of every day of the following week her beautiful
wrought-iron gates were opening and shutting and admitting all kinds and
sorts and shapes and sizes of little girls with brown eyes, long
fingers, pigtails and beaver hats, _about_ ten years of age. And usually
an Aunt or a Step-mother or the Matron of an Orphanage or a Female
Friend accompanied each candidate.

There were three genuine Barbara Allans. But one had reddish hair and
freckles; the second, curly flaxen hair that refused to keep to the
pigtail-ribbon into which it had been tied; and the third, though her
hair was brown, had grey speckled eyes, and looked to be at least
eleven. Apart from these three, there were numbers and numbers of little
girls whose Christian name was Barbara, but whose surname was Allison or
Angus or Anson or Mallings or Bulling or Dalling or Spalding or
Bellingham or Allingham, and so on and so forth. Then there were
Marjories and Marcias and Margarets, Norahs and Doras, and Rhodas and
Marthas, all of the name of Allen, or Allan or Alleyne or Alyn, and so
on. And there was one little saffron-haired creature who came with a
very large Matron, and whose name was Dulcibella Dobbs.

Miss Rawlings, with her broad bright face and bright little eyes, smiled
at them all from her chair, questioned their Aunts and their
Stepmothers, and their Female Friends, and coveted every single one of
them, including Dulcibella Dobbs. But you _must_ draw the line
somewhere, as Euclid said to his little Greek pupils when he sat by the
sparkling waves of the Ægean Sea and drew triangles in the sand. And
Miss Rawlings felt in her heart that it was kinder and wiser and more
prudent and proper to keep strictly to those little girls with the
three-cornered faces, high cheek-bones, “really” bright brown eyes and
with truly appropriate pigtails. With these she fell in love again and
again and again.

There was no doubt in the world that she had an exceedingly motherly
heart, but very few mothers could so nicely afford to _give it rein_.
Indeed, Miss Rawlings would have drawn the line nowhere, I am afraid, if
it had not been for the fact that she had only ten thousand pounds or so
a year.

There were tears in her eyes when she bade the others good-bye. And to
everyone she gave not one bun, not one orange, but a _bag_ of oranges
and a _bag_ of buns. And not merely a bag of ordinary denia oranges and
ordinary currant buns, but a bag of Jaffas and a bag of Bath. And she
thanked their Guardianesses for having come such a long way, and would
they be offended if she paid the fare? Only one was offended, but then
her fare had cost only 3_d._—2_d._ for herself, and 1_d._ (half price)
for the little Peggoty Spalding she brought with her. And Miss Rawlings
paid _her_ sixpence.

She kept thirty little ten-year-olds altogether, and you never saw so
many young fortunate smiling pigtailed creatures so much alike. And Miss
Rawlings, having been so successful, withdrew her advertisements from
the _Times_ and the _Morning Post_ and the _Daily Telegraph_ and the
_Spectator_, and she bought a most beautiful Tudor house called Trafford
House, with one or two wings to it that had been added in the days of
Good Queen Anne, and William and Mary, which stood in entirely its own
grounds not ten miles from the Parish boundary. The forest trees in its
park were so fine—cedars, sweet chestnuts, and ash and beech and
oak—that you could only get a glimpse of its chimneys from the entrance
to the drive.

Things _are_ often curious in this world, and coincidences are almost as
common as centipedes. So Miss Rawlings was more happy than surprised
when, on looking over this mansion, she counted (and to make sure
counted again) exactly thirty little bedrooms, with some larger ones
over for a matron, a nurse, some parlour-maids, some housemaids, some
tweeny-maids and a boy to clean the button-boots and shoes. When her
legal adviser explained to her that this establishment, what with the
little chests-of-drawers, basins and ewers, brass candlesticks, oval
looking-glasses, mahogany beds, three-legged stools, dimity curtains,
woolly rugs, not to speak of chiffoniers, what-nots, hot-water bottles,
soup ladles, and so on and so forth; not to mention a uniform with brass
buttons for the man with whiskers at the park gate, would cost her at
least six thousand a year, that bee in Miss Rawlings’s bonnet buzzed as
if indeed it _was_ a whole hive gone a-swarming.

“Well, now, my dear Mr. Wilkinson,” she said, “I made a little estimate
myself, being a _business_ woman, and it came to £6,004 10_s._ 0_d._ How
reasonable! I shall be over four pounds in pocket.”

So, in a few weeks everything was ready; new paint, new gravel on the
paths, geraniums in the flower-beds, quilts as neat as daisies on a lawn
on the mahogany beds, and the thirty Barbara Allans sitting fifteen a
side at the immensely long oak table (where once in Henry VIII’s time
monks had eaten their fish on Fridays), the matron with the corkscrew
curls at the top and the chief nurse in her starched cap at the bottom.
And Miss Rawlings, seated in the South bow-window in an old oak chair
with her ebony and ivory stick and her purple bonnet, smiling at her
Barbara Allans as if she had mistaken Trafford House for the Garden of
Eden.

And I must say every single pigtail of the complete thirty bobbed as
merrily as roses in June over that first Grand Tea—blackberry jelly,
strawberry jam, home-made bread, plum cake, the best beef-dripping for
those who had not a sweet or a milk tooth, Sally Lunns, heather honey,
maids-of-honour, and an enormous confection of marchpane, with cupids
and comfits and silver bells and thirty little candles standing up in
the midst of the table like St. Paul’s Cathedral on the top of Ludgate
Hill in the great city of London. It was a lucky thing for the Thirty’s
insides that Grand Teas are not every-day teas.

[Illustration: “THAT FIRST GRAND TEA”]

And so, when all the thirty Pigtails had sung a Latin grace put out of
English by Mr. Moffat and set to a tune composed by a beloved uncle of
Miss Rawlings, who also was now no more, the Grand Tea came to an end.
Whereupon the Thirty (looking themselves like yet another Crocodile with
very fat joints) came and said good night to Miss Rawlings, though some
of them could scarcely speak. And as Miss Rawlings knew that not _all_
little girls like being kissed by comparative strangers, she just shook
hands with each, and smiled at them as if her motherly heart would
almost break. And Dr. Sheppard was Medical Adviser to the thirty little
Pigtailers, and Mr. Moffat came every other Sunday to hear their
catechisms.

And this was the order of the day with the Pigtails in their home. At
half-past seven in Summer, and at nine in Winter, the boy in buttons
rang an immense bell, its clapper tied round with a swab of cotton-wool,
to prevent it from clanging too sonorously. This great quiet bell was
not only to waken from their last sweet dreams the slumbering Pigtails
in their little beds, but to tell them they had yet another half-hour
between the blankets before they had to get up. Then, hair-brushes,
tooth-brushes, nailbrushes, as usual. Then, “When morning gilds the
sky,” and breakfast in the wide white room with the primrose curtains
looking out into the garden. And if any Pigtail happened to have been
not quite so good as usual on the previous day, she was allowed—if she
asked for it—to have a large plateful of porridge, with or without salt,
for a punishment. No less than ninety-nine such platefuls were served
out in the first year—the Pigtails were so high-spirited. Still, it can
be imagined what a thirty-fold sigh of relief went up when breakfast on
December 31st was over and there hadn’t been a hundredth.

From nine _a.m._ to twelve _p.m._ the Pigtails were one and all
exceedingly busy. Having made their beds they ran out into the garden
and woods: some to bathe in the stream, some to listen to the birds,
some to talk and some to sing; some to paint and some to play, and some
to read and some to dance, and some just to sit; and some, high up in a
beech-tree, to learn poems, to make up poems and even to read each
other’s. It all depended on the weather. The sun shone, the rooks cawed,
the green silken leaves whispered; and Miss Rawlings would stand looking
up at them in their venturous perch as fondly as a cat at its kittens.
There was not at last a flower or a tree or an insect or a star in those
parts—or a bird or a little beast or a fish or a toadstool or a moss or
a pebble that the little Pigtails did not know by heart. And the more
they knew them the more closely they looked at them, and the more
closely they looked at them the more they loved them and the more they
knew them—round and round and round and round.

[Illustration: “HIGH UP IN A BEECH-TREE TO LEARN POEMS”]

From twelve to one there were “Lessons”; then dinner, and tongues like
jackdaws raiding a pantry for silver spoons. In the afternoon those who
went for a walk towards the stranger parts, went for a walk. Some stayed
at home in a little parlour and sang in chorus together like a charm of
wild birds. Some did their mending and darning, their hemming and
feather-stitching, and some did sums. Some played on the fiddle, and
some looked after their bullfinches and bunnies and bees and guinea-pigs
and ducks. Then there were the hens and the doves and the calves and the
pigs to feed, and the tiny motherless lambs, too (when lambs there were)
with bottles of milk. And sometimes of an afternoon Miss Rawlings would
come in and sit at a window just watching her Pigtails, or would read
them a story. And Dr. Sheppard asseverated not once, but three times
over, that if she went on bringing them sweetmeats and candies and
lollipops and suckets to such an _extent_, not a single sound white
ivory tooth of their nine hundred or so would be left in the Pigtails’
heads. So Miss Rawlings kept to Sundays.

At five was tea-time: jam on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; jelly on
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; and both on Sundays. From six to
seven there were “Lessons,” and when the little Pigtails were really
tired, which was always before nine, they just slipped off to bed. Some
of them had munched their supper biscuits and were snug in bed indeed
even before the rest had sung the evening hymn. And the evening hymn was
always “Eternal Father”—for being all of them so extremely happy they
could not but be “in peril on the deep.” For happiness in this world may
fly away like birds in corn, or butterflies before rain. And on Sundays
they sang “Lead, kindly light” too, because Miss Rawlings’s mother had
once been blessed by the great and blessed Cardinal Newman. And one
Pigtail played the accompaniment on her fiddle, and one on the
sweet-tongued viola, and one on the harpsichord; for since Miss Rawlings
had read “Barbara Allan” she had given up pianofortes. And then, sleepy
and merry and chattering, they all trooped up to bed.

So this was their Day. And all night, unseen, the stars shone in their
splendour above the roof of Trafford House, or the white-faced moon
looked down upon the sleeping garden and the doves and the pigs and the
lambs and the flowers. And at times there was a wind in the sky among
the clouds; and at times frost in the dark hours settled like meal
wheresoever its cold brightness might find a lodging. And when the
little Pigtails awoke, there would be marvellous cold fronds and
flowerets on their windowpanes, and even sometimes a thin crankling slat
of ice in their water-jugs. On which keen winter mornings you could hear
their teeth chattering like monkeys cracking nuts. And so time went on.

On the very next June 1, there was a prodigious Garden Party at
Trafford House, with punts on the lake and refreshments and lemonade
in a tent in the park, and all the Guardianesses and Aunts and
Stepmothers and Matrons and Female Friends were invited to come and
see Miss Rawlings’s little Pigtails. And some brought their sisters,
and some their nieces and nephews. There were Merry-go-Rounds, Aunt
Sallies, Frisk-and-Come-Easies, a Punch and Judy Show, a Fat Man, a
Fortune-Teller, and three marvellous acrobats from Hong Kong. And
there were quantities of things to eat and lots to see, and
Kiss-in-the-Ring, and all broke up after fireworks and “God Save the
Queen” at half-past nine.

The house, as I keep on saying, was called Trafford House, but the
_Home_ was called “The Home of all the little Barbara Allans and such
like, with Brown Eyes, Narrow Cheekbones, Beaver Hats, and Pigtails,
Ltd.” And it was “limited” because there could be only thirty of them,
and time is not Eternity.

And now there were only three things that prevented Miss Rawlings from
being too intensely happy to go on being alive; and these three were as
follows: (_a_) She wanted to live always at the House—but how could the
Parish get on without her? (_b_) What was she going to do when the
Pigtailers became 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, etc., and grown-up? And (_c_)
How could she ever possibly part with any of them or get any more?

For, you see, Miss Rawlings’s first-of-all Barbara Allan was aged 10,
and had somehow managed to stay there. But because, I suppose, things
often go right in this world when we are not particularly noticing them,
and don’t know how, all these difficulties simply melted away at last
like butter in the sun.

In the first place, Miss Rawlings did at last (in 1888, to be exact, one
year after Queen Victoria’s first Jubilee), did, I say, at last go to
live at the Home of all the little Barbara Allans and such like with
Brown Eyes, Beaver Hats, and Pigtails, Ltd. She was called The Matron’s
Friend, so as not to undermine the discipline. When her Parish wanted
her, which was pretty often, the Parish (thirty or forty strong) came to
see her in her little parlour overlooking the pond with the punts and
the water-lilies.

Next, though how, who can say, the little Pigtails somehow did not grow
up, even though they must have grown older. Something queer happened to
their Time. It cannot have been what just the clocks said. If there
wasn’t more of it, there was infinitely more _in_ it. It was like air
and dew and sunbeams and the South Wind to them all. You simply could
not tell what next. And, apart from all that wonderful learning, apart
even from the jam and jelly and the Roast Beef of Old England, they went
on being just the right height and the right heart for ten. Their brown
eyes never lost their light and sparkle. No wrinkles ever came in their
three-cornered faces with the high cheek-bones; and not a single grey or
silver hair into their neat little pigtails that could at any rate be
seen.

Next, therefore, Miss Rawlings never had to part with any of them or to
search or advertise for any more.

Yet another peculiar thing was that Miss Rawlings grew more and more
like a Pigtail herself. She grew younger. She laughed like a
school-girl. Her face became a little narrower, even the cheek-bones
seemed not to be so wide. As for her bonnets, as time “went on,” they
grew up instead of broadwise. And when she sat in Church with the
Thirty, in the third pew down from Mrs. Tomlington’s, you might almost
have supposed she herself was a widish pigtail, just a little bit
dressed up.

It is true that in the very secretest corner of her heart of hearts she
was still looking for the one and only absolute little Barbara Allan of
her life-long day-dream; but that is how things go. And the thought of
it brought only a scarcely perceptible grave glance of hope and enquiry
into her round brown eyes. But underneath—oh dear me, yes—she was almost
too happy and ordinary and good-natured and homely a Miss Rawlings to be
telling this story about at all.

We all die at last—just journey on—and so did Miss Rawlings. And so did
the whole of the Thirty, and the matron, and the chief nurse, and Mr.
Moffat, and Dr. Sheppard, and the Man with whiskers at the park gates,
_and_ the Boy who cleaned the button-boots; parlour-maids, tweeny-maids,
Mrs. Tomlington and all.

And if you would like to see the Old House and the little graves, you
take the first turning on the right as you leave the Parish Church on
your left, and walk on until you come to a gate-post beyond the
mile-stone. A path crossing the fields—sometimes of wheat, sometimes of
turnips, sometimes of barley or oats or swedes—brings you to a farm in
the hollow with a duck-pond, guinea-fowl roosting in the pines at
evening, and a lovely old thatched barn where the fantailed doves croon
in the sunshine. You then cross the yard and come to a lane beside a
wood of thorn and hazel. This bears a little East, and presently after
ascending the hill beyond the haystack you will see—if it is still
there—The Home of all the little Barbara Allans and such like with Brown
Eyes, Beaver Hats and Pigtails, Ltd.

And not very far away is a little smooth-mown patch of turf with a
beautiful thatched wall round it, which Mr. Moffat consecrated himself.
And there, side by side, sleep the Little Thirty, with their pigtails
beside their narrow bones. And there lie the tweeny-maids, the
parlour-maids, the Man with whiskers at the park gate, and the Boy who
cleaned the button-boots. And there Miss Rawlings, too. And when the
last trump sounds, up they will get as happy as wood-larks, and as sweet
and fresh as morning mushrooms. But if you want to hear any more about
_that_, please turn to the Poems of Mr. William Blake.

                (_From Lady Trenchard’s Visitor’s Book_)

                                                      SIR WALTER RALEIGH


                What is it makes the Perfect Host?
                Not wine and coffee, eggs and toast,
                For these you can get just as well
                In any dreary good hotel;
                Not resolute attempts to please,
                For money will procure you these.
                The Perfect Host thinks vastly less
                Of comfort than of happiness.
                He’s happy; and the overflow
                Belongs to those who come and go.
                Within his house you’ll hear no quarrels
                And very little talk of morals,
                He does not lead a perfect life,
                He sometimes has a perfect wife.
                But this of all his points is best—
                He does not want a perfect guest;
                And even when you go too far
                He’s friendly with you as you are.

        The daylight was fading, and shadowy gloom
        Was creeping and crawling all over the room,
        When out of the fire, like a star in the dark,
        There leapt to the fender a bright little spark.

        “Ha, ha, little children!” it chuckled with glee,
        “I’ve something to tell you, so listen to me!
        This morning, Tom Dull, whom I never admire,
        Was sitting in front of this very same fire;
        And, as it burned dimly, was heard to remark:
        ‘Oh, Mary! There’s nothing in here but a spark!’

        “The spark was myself, and I thought, Well-a-day!
        It’s hard to be judged in that impudent way.
        But stuck to my labours, and shortly, you know,
        Had warmed up the coals to a beautiful glow.

        “I called from their slumbers, the fairies of flame,
        And out on the carpet they merrily came,
        And up all the curtains, a marvel to view,
        They climbed as no others are able to do.

        “They peeped in the corners where shadows lay hid,
        And chuckled: ‘We’ve found you! Come out!’ and they did.
        Thus, darting about in the liveliest play,
        They caught all the shadows and drove them away.

        “I’m certain they laughed, though you think it absurd;
        For never a sound of that laughter was heard.
        Yet where is the wonder, for who will dispute
        That hearts often laugh when the lips are quite mute?

        “That’s all. But in parting, oh, take it from me
        That sparks of endeavour, though tiny to see,
        May quickly grow stronger and end, as you guess,
        In lighting the beautiful fire of success.
        My task is accomplished. Good-bye!” said the spark—
        And, giving one flash, he went out in the dark.

                               Theophania

                                                     ADELAIDE PHILLPOTTS


Peter-Wise was a clever young peasant who lived in a little village that
looked like a dimple in the hillside. He owned fifty mooing cows, one
hundred baaing sheep, forty grunting pigs, two hundred clacking
fowls—and a bellowing bull. And he prophesied that in ten years’ time he
would have doubled these numbers. But with all this wealth, Peter-Wise
lacked the most important creature of all—a wife. Without a wife, what
is the use of fifty cows, one hundred sheep, forty pigs, two hundred
fowls—and a bull?

Now Peter-Wise declared that he would not marry a maiden who was less
than seventeen or more than twenty-two years old, and in the village
there were only six girls between these ages who were not already
betrothed or wed. Of these six, therefore—all of whom, being brought up
on cream and honey and wheaten bread and saffron cake and wild
strawberries, were bonny and plump and fair to see—Peter-Wise decided to
choose the cleverest, who, nevertheless, must be just the least bit less
clever than he was. So, to discover which was the cleverest, for, busy
man that he was with his cows and his sheep and his pigs and his
fowls—and his bull, he had not the time to woo each separately, he
resolved to set them three tasks: one to try their fingers; one to try
their brains; one to try their imaginations; and to marry her who
succeeded best in the three.

[Illustration: “I WILL MARRY WHICHEVER OF YOU CAN PERFORM THREE TASKS”]

So Peter-Wise summoned Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy, and
Theophania, called Tiffany for short—these were the names of the
girls—and said to them:

“Children, I will marry whichever of you can perform to the best
advantage these three tasks: first, to darn a hole in the heel of a
sock; secondly, to open, without touching the keyhole, the big barn door
which is always locked; thirdly, to catch the moon and put it into a
wash-tub.”

Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy said:

“Oh, the sock is easy enough, but the door and the moon——”

Theophania, called Tiffany for short, said: “The door and the moon
should be easy enough, but the sock——”

The three trials were to take place in the morning, afternoon and
evening respectively. So in the morning the six maidens assembled in
Peter-Wise’s parlour—Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy in
their best flowered-prints—Tiffany in a green smock; Tiffany had brown
eyes, but the eyes of the others were five different shades of blue:
speedwell, cornflower, lupin, forget-me-not, and chicory.

Peter-Wise gave them each a sock, out of which he had cut the heel, and
left them for an hour to darn the hole. When he came back the six socks
were lying on the table in a heap, finished. He examined them carefully.
Then he said:

“Five of these socks are so perfectly darned that not one exceeds
another in excellence. The sixth, however, is very badly done—a mere
cobble. Come forward in turn, and let her who darned _this_ sock claim
it.”

Mary tripped forward, looked at the sock, turned up her nose a little
and shook her pretty head. “Not mine,” said she. Then came Sally and
Polly and Minnie and Lucy, also turning up their noses a little and
shaking their pretty heads and saying: “Not mine,” “Not mine,” “Not
mine,” “Not mine.” Lastly, with a twinkle in her eye, came Theophania,
called Tiffany for short.

“Mine,” she said. “I never, never shall be able to darn.”

“The first task is over,” announced Peter-Wise. “This afternoon meet me
outside the big barn door which is always locked, at three o’clock.”

And away trotted Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy and
Tiffany.

At three o’clock they met outside the big barn door, wearing pink and
yellow and blue and white and green sunbonnets, and fluttering together
like butterflies, except Tiffany, who did not wear a bonnet at all, and
she stood by herself, thinking.

Peter-Wise said:

“This door, as you know, is always kept locked. Here is the key. Now,
let me see which of you can open it without touching the keyhole, for I
assure you it can quite easily be done.”

“How can we open a locked door without a key?” said Mary and Sally and
Polly and Minnie and Lucy in dismay, and each thought—“It is useless
trying the handle—besides, I should look so foolish, and the others
would jeer.”

But Tiffany—who always thought her own thoughts, not other
people’s—thought something quite different.

“We give it up,” sorrowfully said Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie
and Lucy.

“And you?” asked Peter-Wise of Tiffany.

Tiffany thought: “Because the door has always been locked before, that
doesn’t prove it is locked to-day. Anyhow, here goes!” And she marched
up to the big barn door, turned the handle, and—opened it wide!

“Oh!” cried Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy. “But it is
always locked!”

“It wasn’t to-day,” said Theophania, called Tiffany for short; and she
could not help laughing, kindly, at the five expressions of surprise on
the five fair faces.

“The second task is over,” said Peter-Wise. “Now go and borrow your
mothers’ wash-tubs, wait till the moon rises, catch it, and put it in
the tub. Then come and fetch me.”

“But,” said Tiffany, “there is only one moon.”

“Exactly,” he replied, “therefore only one of you can succeed.”

Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy whispered together.

“He is making sport of us,” they agreed. “Not even Tiffany can catch the
moon. We must give it up.” And each of them said in her heart: “After
all, so-and-so would make a much better husband.”

So they gave it up.

[Illustration: “THERE, SURE ENOUGH, WAS THE ROUND, SILVER MOON”]

But in the evening Tiffany came to Peter-Wise and said:

“I have caught the moon and put it into mother’s wash-tub. Come and
see.”

“Caught the moon!” exclaimed Peter. “But there it is up in the sky!”

“Not at all,” replied she. “That is not the moon.”

The night was still and warm. Peter-Wise followed Tiffany to a
water-meadow, in the middle of which was her mother’s wash-tub.

“There!” she cried, pointing. “Go and see if the moon isn’t in that
tub.”

So he went up to it, looked over the edge, and there, sure enough, was
the round, silver moon shining up at him.

“Well, but there are not two moons,” he said, looking at the other moon
in the sky.

“How foolish you are!” said Tiffany. “That moon in the sky is just the
reflection of the real moon in this tub.”

Peter-Wise was determined to make sure, so he took a penny out of his
pocket and dropped it into the tub. It fell through the moon with a
splash.

“Oh ho!” he exclaimed. “Whoever heard of a penny falling through the
moon? This moon is made of water.”

“Nobody ever tried to throw a penny through before,” said Tiffany.

Then Peter-Wise kicked the tub, and the moon began to wobble. A piece of
it splashed over the edge on to his boots.

“Whoever heard of the moon being spilt?” he asked.

“Nobody ever tried to spill it before,” said Tiffany.

Peter-Wise stroked his chin.

“I have it!” he cried, and grasping the tub, heaved it sideways and
upset the mock moon on to the grass, where with little watery sighs it
slowly disappeared.

“So much for your moon,” said he. “And behold its reflection is still in
the sky!” But Tiffany only laughed and laughed and laughed.

“Yes,” said Peter to himself, “she is certainly the cleverest girl in
the village, but just the least bit less clever than I am. I will marry
her.” And aloud he said:

“Theophania, you shall, in spite of the sock and the moon that was not a
moon, be my wife.”

“Peter-Wise,” she answered, “you shall not win me so easily. There is a
task that _you_ shall perform for _me_ before I will marry you.”

“Well, that is only fair after all,” said he, rather taken aback.

“It is quite out of the question for me to marry you before I can darn a
sock,” she continued, “but in six years I shall have perfected myself in
that difficult art. Will you wait for me six years?”

This she said to try his love.

“I will wait,” said he, who really loved her, and knew something about
women.

Now, at the end of three months Peter-Wise was still waiting for
Theophania, and she realised that he would keep his word for the rest of
the six years. But meanwhile she had learnt to darn as beautifully as
Mary and Sally and Polly and Minnie and Lucy, who by this time were
betrothed respectively to John and James and William and Tom and Adam.
So she came to him one day with an example of her darning, and said:

“Peter, it has not taken me so long to learn to darn as I thought it
would. How would it be if we were married _before_ the six years are
up?”

“We will get married whenever you please, dear heart,” he said, not
surprised.

“Well then,” she replied, “—to-morrow.”

And they were married at eleven o’clock the next morning.

      Into a storeroom once Miss Weasel came,
      Through a small hole squeezing her lank lean frame:
      From illness she had grown so slender.
      Once in, she made complete surrender
      To her capacious appetite,
      Nibbling and guzzling day and night.
      The life she led, Lord only knew,
      Or the amount of bacon she got through—
      Small wonder she grew chubby, plump, and sleek!
      After this diet for a week,
      She heard some noise which made her wish to egress.
      Where was the hole? She scuttled to and fro.
      Surely ’twas this one? No—then this? Still less.
      “Well, bless my soul!” she said, “’twas here, I know,
      I wriggled through, hardly a week ago.”
      A rat perceived how she was troubled.
      “Since you’ve been here,” said he, “your paunch has doubled.
      Thin you came in, and thin you must go out.”

      This has been said to others, I’ve no doubt;
      But Reader, be it far from you or me
      To press the delicate analogy.[2]

              I praised the daisies on my lawn,

                My garden stones, improved by moss,
                She moved—and that was Beauty’s loss.
              When I adored the sunlight, she
              Kept a bright fire indoors for me.
                  She saw I loved the birds, and that
                  Made her one day bring home a cat.
              She plucks my flowers to deck each room,
              And make me follow where they bloom.
                  Because my friends were kind and many,
                  She said—“What need has Love of any?”
              What is my gain, and what my loss?
              Fire without sun, stones bare of moss,
                  Daisies beheaded, one by one;
                  The birds cat-hunted, friends all gone—
              These are my losses: yet, I swear,
              A love less jealous in its care
                  Would not be worth the changing skin
                  That she and I are living in.

                              DENIS MACKAIL


Once upon a time there was a very naughty little girl called Freda. She
was what is known as an only child, and so you might have thought that
her father and mother and her grandparents and her uncles and aunts and
her nurse would have had all the more time for teaching her to be good.
But though this was perfectly true, and they all worked very hard at
saying “Don’t do that, Freda,” or “Put that down at once!” she continued
to be extremely naughty.

She never tried to be polite to anybody, she used to tear her clothes on
purpose, she used to break her toys, and walk in puddles, and snatch
things from other children, and say things that weren’t true, and eat
gravel and blow bubbles in her milk. If there are any other naughty
things that I have forgotten to mention, then she did them too. And when
she was scolded, instead of saying she was sorry, she used to lie down
on the ground and bellow at the top of her voice.

For this reason the people who knew her best grew to be rather careful
about scolding her—especially in the Park, where her behaviour had often
attracted quite a crowd; but, of course, the only result of this was
that she became far naughtier than ever.

Is that perfectly clear? Well, now we come to the story.

One afternoon she was taken to a children’s party, where there was not
only a bran-pie but also a conjuror. Freda was fairly good while she was
being dressed, and still fairly good while she was driving there in the
taxi with her nurse, but as soon as she got to the party itself she just
let herself go. She made a face at a little boy who was smaller than she
was until he cried and had to be taken to sit upstairs. She snatched a
balloon from another child and burst it, so that the child also cried
and had to be taken to sit upstairs. And when the bran-pie came in, she
felt about in it for nearly two minutes until she had found the largest
parcel—which, of course, is cheating—and afterwards, because she didn’t
like what was inside, she forced another little girl to change presents
with her, and the other little girl cried and had to be taken to sit
upstairs.

And when the conjuror was in the middle of his most difficult trick and
had just got to the part where he was going to cut open an orange and
take out of it a watch which he had borrowed from the father of the
little girl who was giving the party, I am sorry to say that Freda
shouted out: “It isn’t the same orange!”

This was exceedingly naughty of her, and distressed the conjuror more
than I can say, as well as spoiling all the pleasure of the good
children who thought it _was_ the same orange. And several of them were
so much upset that they cried, and had to be taken to sit upstairs.

Freda’s nurse had seen her doing all these naughty things, but she had
said to herself: “It’s no use my saying anything to Miss Freda now,
because if I do she will only lie down on the floor and bellow at the
top of her voice. It will be better to speak to her about it when we get
home.” So she contented herself by making a stern face when she thought
that Freda and no one else could see her. Only, as a matter of fact, she
did this just at the wrong moment and missed Freda altogether, and only
succeeded in frightening a little boy in a kilt. And he cried, and had
to be taken to sit upstairs.

So Freda went on being naughtier and naughtier, and the room upstairs
became fuller and fuller of other children, but the lady whose little
girl was giving the party didn’t like to say anything because she
thought, “Freda is an only child, and, anyhow, I needn’t ask her another
time.” And Freda’s nurse didn’t like to say anything because (as I have
already told you) she was afraid that Freda might disgrace her by lying
down on the floor and bellowing at the top of her voice.

Is that all perfectly clear? Well, now we get on to what happened next.

All the children went into the dining-room, where there were so many
buns and chocolates and crackers and pink cakes and sandwiches and other
things of this nature that their eyes nearly popped out of their heads.
And in the middle of the biggest table there was an enormous cake, and
on the top of the enormous cake there was a rather smaller cake, and on
the top of the rather smaller cake there was a golden star.

And as soon as Freda saw this golden star, she pointed at it (which, of
course, she shouldn’t have done) and said in a very loud, clear voice:
“I WANT THAT STAR.”

If only her nurse had heard these words, she would most certainly have
said something which would have made Freda lie down on the floor and
bellow at the top of her voice. For there is no need to explain how
naughty it is to point at things in other people’s houses and say that
you want them. No grown-up person would ever dream of doing a thing like
that.

But, as a matter of fact, the nurse had just met another nurse who was a
great friend of hers, and although they had had a long talk in the Park
only that very morning, they still found they had so much to tell each
other that neither of them heard what Freda was saying.

Is that all perfectly clear? Well, now Freda really _is_ going to be
naughty.

For I am grieved to say that, having pushed a number of other children
out of the way (several of whom cried and had to be taken to sit
upstairs) she went on pushing until she had got right up to the middle
table. And then, when no one was looking, she stood up very quickly on a
chair and snatched at the golden star.

I really don’t know what, exactly, she meant to do with it, because she
had no pocket in her party frock; and very likely if she had been left
to herself she would have got tired of the golden star and dropped it
under the table.

But just at this moment a little boy in a white silk blouse looked up
and saw what she had done.

“Oh!” he said, in a very loud, clear voice. “Freda has taken the golden
star.”

And all the other children began to shout and tell each other that Freda
had taken the golden star. And Freda’s nurse heard the noise, and came
quickly to see what had happened.

“What’s the matter, Miss Freda?” she said. “What did you do?”

“Nothing,” said Freda.

“She did,” said a little girl who had just lost all her front teeth.
“She took the golden star off the top of the cake.”

“Put it back at once,” said Freda’s nurse.

“Shan’t!” said Freda.

And then the nurse saw it in her hand and tried to take it from her. And
Freda never stopped to think what the star might be made of, but put it
very quickly into her mouth, and crunched it into three bits, and
swallowed them all with one swallow.

“I’ve swallowed it,” she said.

Her nurse turned first pink, then white, and then green in the face.

“Put it out at once,” she said.

“I can’t,” said Freda. “It’s gone.”

“Oh dear,” said the nurse. “Does anyone know what that star was made
of?”

But nobody knew what the star was made of. Even the mother of the little
girl whose party it was didn’t know.

“What did it taste like?” they asked Freda.

But she had swallowed it so quickly that she didn’t know.

“You’re a very naughty little girl,” said the nurse. And of course you
can all guess what happened then. Freda got off her chair and lay down
on the floor, and began to bellow at the top of her voice.

But it was far too serious a case to be treated merely by sending her to
sit upstairs. For all that anyone knew the star might have been made of
the most deadly kind of poison. So Freda’s nurse ran off and found her
shawl, and she picked her up off the floor (where she was still
bellowing at the top of her voice) and wrapped the shawl round her and
carried her away and put her into a taxi, and they drove back to Freda’s
home, and she missed the dancing altogether—which served her perfectly
right.

And when they got home, the nurse went to the cupboard in the corner of
the room and took out a very large bottle and a very small glass, and
filled the very small glass from the very large bottle, and then she
said to Freda:

“Now you must drink this.”

At these words Freda lay down on the floor and bellowed at the top of
her voice.

“If you don’t drink it,” said the nurse, “you will have a terrible
pain.”

“Whoo-hoo-hoo,” said Freda (for this was the way that she bellowed), and
she crawled right under the table—in her best frock—and stayed there.

“Now, Miss Freda,” said the nurse presently, when everything else had
failed, “I shall put this glass on the table here, and I shall go
upstairs and turn on your bath, and if you haven’t drunk it by the time
I come back again, I shall be very angry indeed.”

Then she left the room, and after a second Freda came out from under the
table and picked up the glass and sloshed all the slimy stuff in it into
the fireplace, and it spluttered and fizzed and disappeared from sight.

And when she had done this, she was terribly frightened.

She was so frightened that when the nurse came back and said, “Ah,
that’s a good little girl. I see you’ve drunk it all up nicely,” she
never said anything at all. She didn’t even bellow at the top of her
voice.

All the time she was having her bath she was trying to say what she had
done, but she never could quite bring herself to do it. And after she
was in bed she called out suddenly to her nurse, meaning to say what she
had done with the slimy stuff in the little glass; but when the nurse
came in, she just couldn’t get it out. She pretended that she had wanted
a drink of water, and the nurse gave it her and went away again, and
Freda was left alone—still feeling terribly frightened.

“Supposing,” she thought, “that star really _was_ made of poison.
Supposing that stuff I threw in the fire might have saved me. Oh dear,
if the poison kills me now, it will be all my own fault.”

It was a long time before she could go to sleep, and in the morning she
hadn’t been awake for more than five minutes when it all came back to
her. But she had left it so long now, that it was quite impossible to
tell anyone.

Is that all perfectly clear? Well, now I’ll tell you something that
Freda doesn’t know to this day.

The mother of the little girl who had given the party had been so
anxious about Freda that the very first thing in the morning she had
telephoned to the shop where the cake had come from, and had asked the
lady there what the star was made of. And the lady had said: “Sugar.”
And the mother of the little girl who had given the party had telephoned
to Freda’s house and had asked to speak to Freda’s nurse and had told
her that the star was made of sugar. And when Freda’s nurse heard this
she was very much relieved, but at the same time she wasn’t going to
tell Freda that she had made her drink that slimy stuff (as she thought)
for nothing at all. “If I do that,” she said to herself, “I shall never
get Miss Freda to drink any medicine again.”

So she said nothing; and Freda—who of course hadn’t drunk even a drop of
the slimy stuff—went about wondering when the poison was going to begin
working, and whether it would hurt horribly when it did.

She was so frightened now that if only she could have got at the large
bottle, she would have drunk it all up without saying anything—and that
really _would_ have made her ill. But she couldn’t get at the large
bottle, because the cupboard was out of her reach.

And so what do you think she did?

She went to the china pig in which she kept all her money, and she shook
it and rattled it and waved it and waggled it until at last a very
bright sixpence (which her grandfather had once given her) rolled out on
to the floor. And she picked up this sixpence, and waited carefully
until her nurse went up to the bathroom to wash out the party frock
which had got all dirty from being under the table last night, and then
she ran downstairs very quickly and let herself out by the front door
and ran off to the chemist’s shop, which was just round the corner.

The chemist was a very old man with spectacles, and in the ordinary way
Freda was rather frightened of him, but she was still more frightened of
being poisoned, so she pushed open his door—which, always made a little
bell ring—and went straight up to his counter and knocked on it with her
sixpence.

Presently the old chemist came out and looked at her through his
spectacles.

“And what can I do for you, miss?” he said.

“I want to buy some medicine,” said Freda, “that would save someone from
being poisoned by a golden star on the top of a cake at a party. And it
mustn’t cost more than sixpence, because that’s all I’ve got.”

“Dear, dear,” said the chemist. “And are you the little girl who ate the
golden star?”

Freda would have liked to say “No,” but she didn’t dare.

“Yes,” she said, in a very small voice.

“Dear, dear,” said the chemist again. “That wasn’t very good of you, was
it?”

“No,” said Freda, in a still smaller voice.

“And when did you eat it?” asked the old chemist.

“Yesterday,” said Freda.

“And do you still feel quite well?” asked the old chemist.

“Yes,” said Freda. “But I only pretended to drink the slimy stuff they
gave me last night, and I’m afraid the poison may still be waiting
inside me.”

“It seems to me,” said the chemist, “that what you really need is some
medicine to make you good. Eh?”

He looked at her very hard through his spectacles as he said this, and
Freda agreed at once.

“Very well,” said the chemist. “You’ve come to me just in time. When I
close this shop to-night I’m never coming back, and next week they’re
going to start pulling it down. But I’ve got just one dose of medicine
for naughty children left, and you shall have it now.”

Then he took Freda round behind the counter, and she watched him while
he poured a little from one bottle, and a few drops from another, and a
teaspoonful from a third, and just a dash from a fourth. And he mixed
them all together until the stuff fizzed and turned pink, and then he
poured most of it away and gave the rest to Freda.

“If you drink this,” he said, “it will make you good for twenty-four
hours.”

She drank it down, and it tasted delicious.

“Thank you very much,” she said. “And here’s the sixpence.”

“Thank _you_, miss,” said the old chemist. “And here’s your change.”

And he gave Freda half-a-crown from his pocket, and she ran back home as
fast as she could and found the front door still open. So she ran right
up to the nursery, and she dropped the half-crown into the china pig,
and just at that moment the nurse came down from the bathroom.

“Why, Miss Freda,” she said; “how quiet you’ve been.”

“I cannot see,” said Freda, “why any child should ever be anything but
quiet. Can you, my dear nurse?”

She was good now, you see, because the pink medicine was beginning to
work. And this is the way that good children talk. But the nurse
couldn’t make it out.

“Well,” she said, with a laugh, “I’m sure it’s strange to hear you say
that, Miss Freda.”

“I fear,” said Freda, “that I have often been extremely thoughtless in
the past, and that I have often allowed my temper to get the better of
me, with the result that I have lain down on the floor and bellowed at
the top of my voice. I can only express my regret that this should have
been so, and my hope that you will overlook the trouble which I must
have given you.”

The nurse opened her mouth very wide and stared.

“Good gracious, Miss Freda!” she said. “What _has_ come over you?”

“Nothing, that I am aware of,” said Freda. “And now, if you will be good
enough to dress me, I think it is time for us to go up to the Park.”

The nurse was more puzzled than ever, for Freda used almost always to
make a fuss about going out. But she was still more puzzled by the time
they came in again. For Freda hadn’t walked in a single puddle, she had
insisted on keeping her gloves on, she hadn’t run, she hadn’t shouted,
and she had refused to play with her usual friends because she said
their games were so noisy and rough.

At lunch time she asked for a second helping of plain rice-pudding, and
ate every scrap of it.

“This can’t last,” said the nurse to herself. But it did. And after tea,
when Freda went down to the drawing-room, she quite terrified her mother
by asking to be taught a hymn—although her father had just offered to
play at tigers with her.

At half-past six she kissed her father and mother and went up to bed
without being fetched. While she was having her bath, instead of
splashing—and screaming when it was time to come out—she told her nurse
how she had decided to give all her toys to the poor children who hadn’t
got any. As soon as she was put to bed, she lay quietly down and went
fast to sleep.

The nurse and Freda’s mother had a long talk together that evening.

“I don’t see how she can be ill, mum,” said the nurse, “because she’s
eaten everything, and made no fuss about it at all. I just can’t make it
out.”

“I don’t like it,” said Freda’s mother. “There’s nothing we can do now,
and she’s certainly sleeping very peacefully—though I’ve never seen that
look on her face before. But if she’s no different in the morning, I
shall send for the doctor.”

In the morning Freda was just the same, and her mother sent for the
doctor.

“It is very kind of you, dear mother,” said Freda, when she was told,
“but I am feeling perfectly well. Would it not be better if the doctor
were to visit some of the poor children in the hospital?”

And this alarmed Freda’s mother so much that she went quickly to the
telephone, and asked Dr. Tomlinson to put off all his other patients and
come at once. When he arrived, he found Freda sitting bolt upright in
her little chair and reading a lesson-book.

“Well, my little dear,” he said, “and how do you feel this morning?”

“It is very good of you to ask,” said Freda. “I am happy to say that I
am in the best of health. However, if you have a few minutes to spare,
perhaps you would be kind enough to hold my book, and see whether I have
yet learnt this beautiful poem about the poor little chimney-sweep.”

The doctor did nothing of the sort.

“I’m very glad you sent for me,” he told Freda’s mother, and he picked
Freda up and felt her pulse and looked at her tongue and put his head
first against her chest and then against her back.

“Well,” he said at length; “this beats me. The child seems to be
perfectly well, and yet....” And he scowled and puffed out his cheeks
and walked up and down, while all the time Freda’s mother and the nurse
waited in the utmost anxiety.

And then all of a sudden the clock struck, and as it was twenty-four
hours since Freda had swallowed the magic dose, the effect vanished in a
single instant.

The grown-up people who were watching her saw her jump out of the chair,
and fling the lesson-book on the ground.

“Now, now,” said Dr. Tomlinson, “oughtn’t you to be more careful with
that pretty book?”

Freda gave one look at him, and then she lay down on the floor and
bellowed at the top of her voice.

“Thank heaven!” said her mother.

“Our dear little Miss Freda has come back to us,” said the nurse.

“Hum-ha,” said Dr. Tomlinson. “Yes, I think we have cured her.”

He had to say this, you see, because he was a doctor. But Freda’s mother
was so glad that her little girl was herself once more, that she thanked
him over and over again. And all the time Freda lay on the floor and
bellowed at the top of her voice, and from that moment she was just as
naughty as ever she had been before.

I hope that’s all perfectly clear. Some people say that this story will
encourage little girls to be naughty, by making them think that their
parents and nurses prefer them like that. I should be very sorry if this
were so, but of course it’s no use pretending that anything happened
otherwise than I have said.

Freda never had another dose of the magic medicine, because the old
chemist never came back to his shop, and—as he had said—the next week
the men came and began to pull it down. But of course she didn’t go on
being naughty for ever, because after a bit she grew up, and now she
actually has a little girl of her own. And if there’s one thing that’s
absolutely certain, it is that all grown-up people are always good.




                       The Rhyme of Captain Gale

                                                              A. PEMBURY


                Oh, Captain Gale who sails the sea,
                When waves are high and winds are free,
                Will kiss his hand, to make it plain
                How much he scorns the hurricane;
                A most imprudent thing to do
                While sailing on the ocean blue.

                He walks his deck, I’ve heard it said,
                When wiser sailors lie in bed,
                And far upon the lonely foam,
                He takes his food as if at home
                (Including plates of greasy stew);
                A thing that I could never do.

                His ship may toss, his ship may pitch,
                He doesn’t mind a morsel which;
                And never seems to care a bit
                How deep the sea is under it—
                Though this, to me, beyond a doubt,
                Is something he should care about.
                But sailors always were, to me,
                A singular community.

                  The roof is high above my head,
                      With arches cool and white;

                      It is a curious sight.

                    OLAF THE FAIR AND OLAF THE DARK

                                                         CYNTHIA ASQUITH


Once upon a time there lived two boys who were each called Olaf. One had
golden curls clustered all over his head—curls so glittering that every
woman’s hand must touch their brightness: and to look into his eyes was
to see the gleam of blue sky through two rounded windows. In short, he
was the most beautiful child that his mother had ever seen.

The other Olaf was crowned with dark curls—blue-black as the plumage of
a crow. And to look into his eyes was to see twin stars shine up through
the brown depths of a mountain stream. In short, he was the most
beautiful child that his mother had ever seen.

Now, these two Olafs had both been born on exactly the same day, but
Olaf the Fair was the son of a mighty King, and lived in a dreadfully
big palace, and Olaf the Dark was the son of a poor shepherd, and lived
in a dreadfully small cottage.

When Olaf the Fair learned to walk, he staggered across a vast floor,
and if he tumbled, it was only to sink into the soft depths of thick
carpets. In his nursery there was nothing dangerous—not even the corners
were allowed to be sharp—so he never knew the fun of watching bruises
turn from plain brown to yellow and purple and green.

But Olaf the Dark learned to walk in quite a different way; he staggered
across an uneven floor of cold stone, in a small room, crowded with
things from whose sharp corners Pain constantly darted out at him. The
hard floor seemed to rise up and smite him, first in one place and then
in another. His mother was always kissing these places to make them
well. He liked these kisses and was proud of his scarred body,
especially of the red knees across which his seven skins were never seen
all at once. His knees generally looked as though raspberry jam had been
spread over them.

Just as you do, both Olafs hated to go to bed, but, just as you do, to
bed they both had to go. Olaf the Fair plunged his bright head into a
large pillow—so soft that it almost met across his nose, whilst the
small pillow on which Olaf the Dark laid his dark head was so bumpy and
so hard that in the morning his bruised ear would often ache, he knew
not why.

[Illustration]

Both boys loved to eat and drink. Olaf the Fair was fed on every sort of
delicious food. You should have seen his nursery table piled high with
glowing fruits, coloured cakes and trembling jellies. Chicken came every
day, and there was always jam for tea. Olaf the Dark seldom swallowed
anything more dainty than lumpy porridge, black bread and just a very
little bacon. Yet he often knew a treat, that was far greater than any
of the dainties in the palace, and this was the taste of his plain food
when he was very hungry—so hungry that his empty place was just
beginning to hurt.

His father lay all crumpled up with rheumatism, so that, almost as soon
as Olaf the Dark could walk, he had to shoulder the shepherd’s heavy
staff, whistle to the sheep-dog, and stride forth to guard his father’s
flocks.

Watching the baaing sheep as they nibbled the short grass, their bells
tinkling as they moved, the lonely little shepherd-boy shivered in the
cold, wet winds of winter and gasped in the scorching heats of summer.
He would have liked to stay at home, learning to read by the leaping
fire whilst his mother stirred the porridge, but day after day, he had
to put on his little sheepskin suit, and go out to be hurt by
hailstones, terrified by thunder or soaked in the snow.

The year Olaf the Fair was born his father died, so he became king, the
smallest king that ever was seen. His crown was heavy and made his head
ache. His sad, smiling mother said he must learn how to be a wise king.
This meant doing hundreds and hundreds of lessons. Whilst ten tutors
tried to stuff figures and facts into his head, he would stare out
through the windows wistfully watching all the different sorts of
weather. Oh, how he longed to be out in the hail, the thunder, or the
snow!

One day as Olaf the Dark sat by his sheep on the high hillside and
played on his flute to keep himself company, a huge brown mastiff came
into sight. Olaf’s faithful sheep-dog pricked his ears and low thunder
rumbled in his shaggy throat. The fierce mastiff sped along the ground,
and in the blinking of an eye the two dogs had flown at one another’s
throats. Terrified, Olaf the Dark strove with his staff to beat them
apart, but all in vain. Fortunately four horsemen, who were the little
king’s escort, now galloped up and, leaping from their saddles,
contrived to separate the foam-flecked, blood-spattered dogs.

“Well for thee, lad, we were at hand,” said the tallest of the men.
“’Twould have gone ill with thy mongrel had he harmed the king’s pet.”

“It was your dog’s fault! He attacked mine!” indignantly answered Olaf
the Dark.

“Hush!” said the man roughly. “Here is the king. Bow down to him, you
saucy lad!”

For Olaf the Fair had just ridden up. The man held the reins of the
snow-white palfrey and the little king dismounted to assure himself of
his mastiff’s safety.

Now, Olaf the Dark had never even seen a picture-book, and at the
dazzling sight of Olaf the Fair he gasped in amazement. The little king
was clad in velvet of shimmering blue, edged with shining silver and on
his head was a crown of gold.

He approached the shepherd-boy, and the two Olafs, who were of exactly
the same size, stared long at one another.

“I’m glad your dog is not harmed. How long have you had him?” said the
king. “Wolf was only given to me yesterday.”

“Sentry is my father’s,” answered the shepherd. “He had him before I was
born.”

“How old are you?” asked the king.

“I was seven years yesterday,” answered the shepherd.

“Were you? That’s funny!” exclaimed the king. “Why I had my seventh
birthday yesterday, too. But, who is with you? Surely you aren’t allowed
to stay out by yourself, are you?”

“I _have_ to stay out,” replied the shepherd. “I should like to go
home.”

“You’d like to go home? Funny! Why, I’d give anything to be allowed to
sit on that silvery frost! Have you been playing with those nice woolly
sheep for long? What pretty bells they’ve got! And wherever did you get
that splendid crook’d staff? I’d like to have one just like that,”
chattered the little king.

“Sire,” broke in the tall man with a low bow. “We must return home. His
Excellency your Tutor-in-Chief said that only one hour could be spared
from your Majesty’s studies to-day.”

Olaf the Fair stamped his foot.

“Oh, bother!” he cried. “I can’t bear to go in to yawny lessons! I want
to stay out in the shininess. I say, Boy, when have you got to go home
and do lessons?”

“Don’t do any lessons,” grunted Olaf the Dark.

“You don’t do any lessons?” exclaimed Olaf the Fair. “Oh, you _are_ a
lucky one! How long will you stay out?”

“Till it gets dark. The sheep must graze till then.”

“Till it gets dark? Oo-oo-oo-ee! Lovely! I’ve never been out in the
night. I would like to see how the stars get there. Have you ever seen
one just pricking through the blackness? But, where’s your coat? ’Twill
surely be cold before ’tis dark.”

“Don’t have a coat.”

“Don’t you wear anything but just that one dead sheep? It must be
beautifully comfortable. My clothes are so hot and heavy,” said the
king, tugging at his rich robes.

“Sire?” pleaded the attendant.

“All right, I’m coming,” said Olaf the Fair, and reluctantly mounting
his palfrey, he turned its arched neck towards the distant palace.
“Good-bye, Boy. Wish I could stay and play with you and your sheep.”

Wistfully Olaf the Dark gazed after the gay figure of the king
disappearing into the rising mists, and as he rode away, Olaf the Fair
turned his head, weary with the weight of his crown, and stared long at
the solitary figure of the sturdy little shepherd. Disconsolately, he
listened to the tinkling bells till they died away in the distance.

Deep in thought, his forgotten flute on the grass, the shepherd-boy sat
on. Hours passed. The sun sank in flaming glories of orange and gold.
Dusk thickened into darkness and heavy drops of rain fell coldly on his
bare head. Still pondering, Olaf the Dark at last rose and wearily drove
his drowsy sheep towards home.

He sat down to his supper. Silently he spooned his burnt porridge and
gnawed at his crust of black bread.

“What’s come to thee, son?” asked his mother. “I miss the gabble of thy
tongue.”

“I’ve seen the king, mother,” said Olaf, and he told her the story of
the dog fight.

“Seen his small majesty, have you? To think of it! Born the very same
day as you, he was. Be you two boys much of a size?”

“Yes, he’s no taller nor I and I guess I’m the stronger. But oh, mother,
the lovely horse he was riding, and the clothes he had on him, and the
glittering crown on his head! ’Twas as though he had caught rays from
the sun itself! Oh, mother, I’d like to be a king the same as him, and
ride around in coloured clothes, nor need to mind no silly sheep.”

“Is it wanting to be a king you are, Olaf?” laughed his mother. “Sure,
there’s no contentment under the sun. But I’m thinking a good shepherd’s
better nor a bad king, and they’re saying to be a good king’s no easy
calling—subjects being more unaccountable troublesome than sheep
themselves. Anyways, you two lads have the same God to serve, and sure
you can serve Him from a cottage just as easy as from a palace. To be a
good shepherd’s a proud thing, I’m thinking, and as for the rheumatics,
they enters the joints be you high or be you low.”

But Olaf the Dark was not to be consoled. For the first time he noticed
the shabbiness of his sheepskin suit, and the smallness of the cottage.
Discontentedly he looked around.

“What would the king’s palace be like?” he asked.

“Oh!” said his mother. “They do say it be all marble and gold with
thousands of lights a-twinkling from the ceiling, and I’ve heard as the
wee king sleeps in a bed that’s bigger nor this room and the roof of
it’s of gold and there be curtains to it.”

Olaf the Dark blinked.

“Oo-oo-oo-ee!” he sighed, as though sucking the sweetest of sweets.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Now, that same evening, when bedtime came, Olaf the Fair pressed his
face against the cold bars of the window and stared wistfully at the
spangled blue-blackness outside. He thought with envy of the
shepherd-boy out there all alone on the hidden hill. For the little king
yearned to go out while darkness was spread over the earth. How
mysterious the world looked! What, he wondered, happened to all the
ordinary daylight things during the night? If he were outside would he
be able to see his shadow and what would the flowers and the trees be
doing?

After he had climbed into his high, soft, golden bed, the queen came in
to say good night.

“Oh, mother!” he said, snuggling into her white arms, “I’ve done such a
dreadful, dreadful lot of lessons to-day.”

“Poor little Olaf,” said the Queen, kissing her son.

“Oh, mother,” the little king continued, “I saw such a nice boy to-day
out on the hill. And isn’t he lucky? He doesn’t do any lessons at all,
and he’s allowed to stay out by himself with nothing but a lot of sheep.
Mayn’t I have some nice woolly sheep to play with, mother?”

“Sheep aren’t toys, Olaf. They’re duties, like lessons. The boy must
have been a shepherd.”

“Duties, are they, mother? Then I’d much rather do sheep than do
lessons. But was he a real shepherd, that boy? Why, he’s only my age!
Oh, mother, can’t I be a shepherd?”

“You are a sort of shepherd, Olaf. But you’ve got human beings to look
after instead of animals. I want you to be so good a king that I shall
be proud that you were my baby. That’s why you have to work so hard.”

“I do try, mother. But I wish I was a proper out-of-doors shepherd. And
please, mother, must I always wear my crown? It is so heavy, and it
bites my forehead.”

“Yes, darling. I am afraid you must. Your crown is to remind you that
you are a king and not your own master. Now go to sleep and dream that
you are a shepherd and have to shiver out of doors in all the cold and
wet. You’d soon be glad to wake up in your own bed.”

But Olaf the Fair was not to be persuaded.

“I’d love to be out in the rain!” he exclaimed. “I hate indoors, and I’d
like to be dressed in a dead sheep.”

Days, weeks, months passed away, and Olaf the Fair and Olaf the Dark
still continued to think of one another. More and more did the little
king weary of the long lessons which kept him indoors and of all the
solemn attendants who surrounded him. More and more did he pine to be
free and wander at will over the hillside. Above all he yearned to go
out into the night and feel the darkness. When he looked up at the sad,
solemn moon, he would thrill with a strange, unaccountable excitement.
The moon! She flooded the earth with a queer, transforming light that
drew him out of all sleepiness and made his soul shiver till his body
became too excited to lie still. Passionately he envied the shepherd-boy
out there in the darkness, playing his flute beneath the pine trees. One
night the longing grew too strong, and, as he tossed on his golden bed,
it flashed into his memory that the bars of the window in the great hall
were wide enough apart to allow his body to squeeze through them. (This
was long before even kings had glass in their windows.)

He sat upright. The leaves of the trees just outside rustled
mysteriously and tiny twigs tapped against the bars, beckoning him out
of bed. Yes, his mind was made up. He was going to escape and run out
into the strange silvery light that the moon was making. With hammering
heart he slid from his high bed and tiptoed towards the door. There was
a low growl, and the mastiff raised his huge head. Oh, heavens, if he
were to bark, or follow, he would surely arouse the man who slept just
outside across the door! But, fortunately, Olaf remembered the bone he
was to give his dog next morning, and in a moment busy sounds of
scrunching and gulping filled the room.

One danger passed. But now Olaf must step across the body of the man
who, with a dagger in his mouth, guarded his royal master’s door.
Supposing the man were awake. Then the adventure would become impossible
and Olaf would have to return to the dreariness of trying to go to
sleep. Trembling, he turned the handle and pulled the door towards him.
Regular breathing reassured him. The man was fast asleep. Softly as snow
falls on snow, the boy stepped across the huge form and hastened on
swift feet down the long, empty corridor. Shafts of moonlight gleamed
through the round windows and shone on the armour stacked against the
wall. How strange the palace seemed in this light!

A little scared, Olaf slipped down the wide, shallow steps of the huge
staircase. Now he was in the great hall. The night wind blew in and the
tapestries trembled on the walls. Olaf shivered with something that was
more than cold. High up in the sky a pale moon raced through white
trailing clouds. She looked as if she were being pursued.

[Illustration: “THE TWO BOYS STARED AT ONE ANOTHER”]

“I must get out! I must get out!” said Olaf aloud. “I must get out and
run after her.”

He reached the window and seized the bars. Oh, heavens, what was this?
Consternation crushed into his heart, for crisscross along the iron bars
there now ran new horizontal ones. Alas! alas! he had adventured too
late. Impossible now to squeeze through to liberty. His palace was a
prison. In vain he tugged at the cruel bars. They could not even be
shaken. He stamped his foot. Strong sobs shook his small body; tears
scalded his eyes.

But what was this he saw through the dancing blur of his tears? Exactly
opposite, a face stared through at him! The moon had raced behind a
cloud and her light was dim. Was he looking into a mirror instead of out
of doors? No, this pale face was surrounded with dark hair, and now his
fingers felt the touch of other warm fingers. Yes, other hands were
clasping the forbidding bars, and sobs that were not his own fell on his
ear. The moon again sailed forth into the open sky and clearly Olaf the
Fair recognised the face of the shepherd-boy, the constant thought of
whom had so much quickened his discontent. Yes, it was Olaf the Dark,
who, shivering from the cold, stood outside and wistfully gazed at the
warmth and wealth within.

The one craning in, the other craning out, the two boys stared at one
another.

“Why are you crying, Boy?” asked Olaf the Fair.

“Because I can’t get in,” sobbed the little shepherd. “Why are you
crying?”

“Because I can’t get out,” sobbed the little king.

  “Do you want to get _in_?”  }
                                   } shrilled two surprised voices.
  “Do you want to get _out_?” }

“Funny!” they both said, and their next sobs rode up on the top of two
little laughs and their tears fell into the cracks made by their smiles.

Yes, they both laughed and the laughter stretched their hearts, so that
Understanding could enter in and open the door to Contentment. Some
people can only laugh at jokes. If you can laugh at your life even while
it makes you cry, you have learnt more than a thousand schoolroom
lessons can teach you, and your face will be safe from ever growing ugly
through sullenness.

“Why ever do you want to get in here?” asked the king.

“Because it looks so lovely—all gorgeous and glowing. I want to know
what it feels like inside. I’m so cold—I’m quite blue and I mustn’t go
home till morning breaks. I thought I’d squeeze through the bars and
‘catch warm’ and then go back to my sheep. There they are. Do you hear
their bells? But why ever do you want to get out?”

“Because I hate the palace. Ugh! It’s a great big prison. Besides, I
want to feel the moonlight, dance in it, alone and free, and I want to
be cold. I’ve never been cold.”

“Wish I were you!” said both boys at once, smiling as they sighed.

“Where’s your lovely golden crown?” asked Olaf the Dark. “Don’t you
always wear it?”

“Oh, no. I don’t sleep in it. I hang it on its peg. I hate it!”

“Oh, I did want to try it on.”

“You wouldn’t like it. It makes my head ache. It’s so heavy. I’d much
rather have a staff like that crooked one of yours.”

“It’s awfully heavy,” sighed the shepherd.

“Heavy?” exclaimed Olaf the Fair. “I don’t see how a heavy thing in your
hand could matter. Push it through. I want to hold it.”

“Fetch me your crown, then, and we’ll exchange.”

Olaf the Fair knew that it was dangerous to return to his room to fetch
the crown. Supposing the mastiff should bark and awaken the man. But he
longed to handle the shepherd’s staff.

“All right, I’ll fetch it,” he said and tiptoed up the stairs.
Stealthily he stepped across the sleeping man, and the dog, recognising
his master’s scent, made no sound. Olaf seized the crown and hastened
back to the moon-flooded window.

“Here it is,” he said, pushing the crown through the bars that were just
wide enough to let it through. “Try it on, and give me your staff.”

Exultantly, the shepherd placed the gleaming crown on his dark head
while the king grabbed at the tall crook.

“It isn’t a bit heavy! I can’t feel it!” they both exclaimed.

Then for a few minutes they chattered, comparing one another’s days: the
little king complaining of confinement and of being always in a crowd,
the little shepherd complaining of having to stay out of doors and be
all alone.

“Mother says I am the servant of my subjects,” said the king. “And oh,
I’ve got such an awful lot of them! I’d far rather be the master of
sheep, as you are.”

“I’m not their master,” replied the shepherd. “I’m no better than their
slave. Father says so. Besides, they’re really yours. They’ve all got
little crowns stamped on their backs.”

“Have they? That’s funny! Why, my sceptre’s the shape of a shepherd’s
crook.”

As they talked, Olaf the Dark felt the crown beginning to eat into his
forehead. Heavier and heavier it grew until his brows ached and his head
drooped. Meanwhile, in Olaf the Fair’s hand the staff which had seemed
so light grew heavier and heavier. Surely it must be made of lead, he
thought, and at last with a sigh he changed it into his other arm. At
the same moment, with a groan, the shepherd tore the crown from his
head.

“Phew! it _is_ a weight! How can you wear it all day?” he said, pushing
it back through the bars.

“Phew! it _is_ a weight,” said the king, poking the staff through the
bars. “I can’t think how you can carry it all day.”

“Funny,” they both said, and they laughed quite loud; the king, feeling
proud of his head that could carry so heavy a weight, and the shepherd
feeling proud of his right arm, grown strong from carrying so heavy a
staff.

“The dawn breaks,” he said. “I must return to my sheep.”

“Come again,” cried the king. “Come again and talk to me.”

So once in every year the little shepherd returned to the palace walls
and through the bars the boys talked long and eagerly. The king always
told the shepherd how stuffy it was within, and the shepherd always told
the king how cold it was outside, and during the rest of the year,
whenever the king’s discontentment grew, he remembered the weeping boy
who had tried so hard to get _in_. And whenever the shepherd wearied of
his lot, he remembered the boy who wept because he could not get _out_.

The king knew that the shepherd never forgot the heaviness of a king’s
crown, and the shepherd knew that the king never forgot the heaviness of
a shepherd’s staff, and thus each was braced to bear his own burden; for
it is a fact that our burdens are only unendurable when no one
understands how heavy is their weight.

These two boys grew into men. Sorrows they had—as all men have, yet to
each was given much happiness, for the one was a good king and the other
a good shepherd. Far and wide Olaf the Fair was famed as the “Shepherd
of all his People,” and Olaf the Dark, who guarded the royal sheep, was
called the “King of all Shepherds.”




                             The Simple Way

                                                                JOHN LEA


               Said Mr. Wise: “I’m one of those
               Who think a short and pleasant doze
               Will aid in solving, yea or nay,
               Such problems as perplex the day.”

               So, sitting in a comfy chair,
               He stretched his slippers, then and there,
               Toward the fire that glowed and leapt,
               And very soon he soundly slept.

               He soundly slept, or so he thinks,
               For little more than forty winks,
               Then rose with more than common might
               And went and set the world aright.

               To each expectant boy he showed
               The shortest and the straightest road
               That leads to fortune and to fame
               For those who like to play the game.

               To all the girls he made it clear
               How smiles and patience grace the year,
               And how a placid mind will foil
               The wear and tear of daily toil.

               He settled in the smartest way
               The hottest questions of the day,
               And, by a magic mode of thought,
               So deftly on opinion wrought,
               That politicians failed to see
               Why they should longer disagree,
               And forthwith formed, by joint consent,
               _One_ party in our parliament.

               In short, his triumphs were so bright
               While setting all the world aright,
               That when he waked, ’twas sorrow deep
               To find the labours of his sleep
               Had failed the slightest mark to make
               Upon the world he’d left awake.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE.


The present book is the first attempt in the English language at a
connected story of Hungarian literature. The remarkable success achieved
by a few Magyar novelists in English-speaking countries, together with
the growing recognition of the international importance of Hungary as a
state and a nation, seem to justify the assumption, that the Anglo-Saxon
peoples too, are not unwilling to learn more about the intellectual life
of the Magyars than can be found in the ordinary books of reference.

The main object of the author, himself a Hungarian, has been to impress
the reader with a vivid picture of the chief currents and the leading
personalities of Hungarian literature. Magyar literature is too vast a
topic to be fully treated within the very limited space of a small essay
like the present. By introducing the comparative method of historical
investigation and analysis, by means of which Hungarian works are
measured, contrasted to, or compared with works of English, French,
German, Italian or the ancient classical writers, the reader may obtain,
it is hoped, a more life-like idea of a literature hitherto unknown to
him.

No nation outside Hungary has facilities of studying Magyar literature
as great as those offered to the English public in the incomparable
library of the British Museum. Nearly every Magyar work of any importance
may be found there, and the catalogues of those works are, in the strict
sense of the word, correct. This latter circumstance is chiefly owing to
the labours of an English scholar, whose name no Hungarian can pronounce
without a feeling of reverential gratitude. Mr. E. D. Butler, of the
British Museum, the author of the only authentic and comprehensive, if
small, English work on Hungary (his article “_Hungary_” in the last
edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_) is, to our knowledge, the only
English student of Magyar language and literature who has thoroughly
grasped the philology and spirit of that language and the distinctive
qualities of Magyar writers. He will, we trust, pardon our patriotism for
shocking his excessive modesty by this public acknowledgment of his merit.

May this book contribute somewhat to increase the interest of the great
British nation in a nation much less numerous but in many ways akin.

The map of Hungary accompanying this book is, we venture to say, the
first map published outside Hungary based on the most careful comparison
of the original sources. The greatest pains have been taken to ensure
absolute accuracy of names of places and of county boundaries, according
to the most recent data.

HUNGARIAN LITERATURE.




CHAPTER I.


Of the nations in the south-east of Europe, the Hungarians, or Magyars,
are probably the most renowned, and at the same time, the least known.
Although their extensive country has now been in their possession and
under their rule for over one thousand years, and albeit the historic
_rôle_ of the Hungarians, rather than that of Hungary, has been and is
one of no common magnitude, in that, without their secular and successful
fight against Osman ascendancy, Europe could scarcely have maintained
its civilization in the countries east of Munich: yet in spite of all
such claims to attention on the part of western nations, Hungary and the
Hungarians are still largely unknown in England, France and America.

In English-speaking countries no serious attempts have as yet been made
either to tell the stirring story of Hungary’s past, or to analyse the
rich possibilities of her future. Except single and singular features of
Magyar life or natural products, such as the famous “Hungarian” bands
of the Tsiganes or gypsies and their “weird” music; Hungarian flour
and Hungarian wine; and most of all the figure of Hungary’s greatest
political orator, Louis Kossúth; except these and a few more curiosities
relating to Hungary, the proud nations of the west of Europe do not, as
a rule, take notice of all the rest of the life of a nation of eighteen
million persons.

The festivities of the Hungarian millennium celebrated the year before
last, came to the western world as a surprise. Few Englishmen were
prepared to realize the fact that, at a time when their ancestors were
still under small princes of mixed blood, and, moreover, constantly
exposed to, and finally nearly absorbed by foreign conquerors, the
Hungarians had already reared a solid fabric of government on the site
on which for now over a thousand years they have withstood the armies,
the diplomacy and the alien immigration of the Turks, the Germans and the
Slavs. Unconquered by force or disaster, and not denationalized by either
the Germans or Slavs around them, the Hungarians have maintained almost
intact the language and music they brought with them from the Steppes of
Asia; and when in the ripeness of time a Magyar literature was beginning
to develop, it proceeded on lines neither German nor Slav, but thoroughly
Hungarian.

This literature is both in extent and quality, one of the most remarkable
of the lesser literatures of Europe. The number of writers of Magyar
works is no less than 5,000; and their works cover all the provinces of
poetry and of philosophic, historic or scientific inquiry into nature or
man. While accepting the standard of criticism adopted by the recognized
arbiters of literary greatness, we have no hesitation in saying that
Hungarian Literature has a number, if a limited one, of stars of the
first magnitude, and no inconsiderable number of lesser lights. This
fact acquires still greater importance from the consideration that the
bulk of Hungarian Literature properly speaking dates back little over a
hundred years; and that many, far too many Hungarians have, up to recent
times, left their native country and, writing their works in German
or French, added to the literature of nations other than their own.
Comparatively few, exceedingly few, Englishmen have enlisted among the
writers of nations outside the United Kingdom; very many, exceedingly
many Hungarians have, under stress of various circumstances, written in
Latin, German, French or English, and thereby reduced the bulk and often
the quality of Hungarian Literature proper. The number of works in Magyar
published from 1531 to 1711 is 1,793. During the same period 2,443
non-Magyar works were published in Hungary. The preceding two totals
were given in 1879 and 1885 respectively. Up to April, 1897, 404 more
works had been discovered, belonging mostly to the class of non-Magyar
books printed in Hungary down to 1711. When, however, we inquire into
the number of works written by Hungarians and published outside Hungary,
down to 1711, we learn that no less than about 5,000 works were written
and published by Hungarian authors, in 130 non-Hungarian towns, during
the period ending 1711.[1] At a time when all the western peoples had
long ceased to use Latin for all literary purposes, the idiom of Cicero
was still the chief vehicle of thought in Hungary. Nearly all through
the eighteenth, and during the first quarter of the present century, the
number of works written by Hungarians in Latin far outnumbered the works
written by them in Magyar. It was even so with German; and many a famous
German author was really a Hungarian; such as Ladislaus Pyrker, Nicolaus
Lenau, Klein (J. L.), the great historian of the drama, Charles Beck, the
poet, Fessler, the historian, etc.

In comparing Hungarian Literature with the literature of the Germans,
French or English, we cannot but recognize, for the reasons just
mentioned, that the splendour and comprehensiveness of the Literature of
those nations cannot be found in that of the Magyars. At the same time we
make bold to point out an advantage which Hungarian Literature has over
the literature of many another nation, if not in the past, certainly in
the future. This advantage is in the Hungarian language. The Magyars have
a language of their own. It is not a borrowed language; not one taken
from another nation, in whose use it had been for centuries.

The Americans, both in North and South America, although they are in
nearly everything else the counterparts of their European parent-nations,
have yet preserved the idioms of the latter. In politics, social
constitution, individual temper, and attitude of mind, the North and
South Americans are—a long stay in that continent has convinced us of
that—utterly different from either the English or the Spanish. The
Americans proper have indeed built up, or developed into a nation
of their own. For good or for bad, they have a distinct and novel
national personality. One thing excepted; that one thing, however, is
a vital element in the intellectual activity of a nation. We mean, of
course, Language. The Americans have moulded and coloured all the
old elements of their nationality into organs with a tone and hue of
their own. Language alone they have, with slight differences, taken
over and preserved in the very form and woof in which the English and
Spanish had left it in the old colonies. Hence there is between the
Americans, as a new nation, and their language, as an old and foreign
idiom, a discordance and discrepancy that no genius can entirely remove.
The words of a language are mostly gentry of olden descent. Between
them there are associations and tacit understandings ill-fitted for
an environment essentially different from their original cast. This
discrepancy has, there can be little doubt, exercised a baneful influence
on the literature of the American nations. It has baulked them of the
higher achievements, and neither in the literature of North America
nor in that of South America can we meet with literary masterworks of
the first rank. Between the poets and writers of those nations and the
languages they are using there is much of that antagonism which has
always been found to exist between the cleverest of Neo-Latin poets and
the language of Rome. Latin is a dead language; and all the intellectual
atmosphere and soil that nurtured and developed it have long since ceased
to stimulate. Accordingly, the Politiani and Sadoleti, the Sannazari
and Buchanani, and all others who in modern times have tried to revive
Latin literature have entirely failed. As with individuals so it is with
nations. The Belgians, or the Swiss in Europe are, like the Americans,
in the false position of having each a distinct nationality of their own
with languages not their own. This fundamental shortcoming has rendered
and will probably, in all times, render them incapable of reaching the
lofty summits of literature. Language is intimately allied to literature;
language is the mother, and thought the father of literary works. Any
lack of harmony in the parents must needs show in the offspring.

Now the Hungarians have not only a language of their own, but also
one the possibilities of which are far from being exhausted. For the
Hungarians therefore there is no danger of a false position, of an
initial vice in the growth of their literature; and moreover there
are immense vistas of literary exploits still in store for future
generations. The quarries and mines of the Latin and Teutonic languages
have, it may be apprehended, been worked so intensely as to leave scant
margins for new shafts. French has changed little in the last three
generations, and English and German little in the last two; while Italian
and Spanish have long reached the beautiful but stereotyped plasticity of
ripeness. Hungarian, on the other hand, is a young language. The number
of people using and moulding it has been considerably increased in the
last generation, and most of its gold-fields and diamond-layers have
not yet been touched by the prospector’s axe. There is thus an immense
future still open for Hungarian Literature, and this prospective, but
certain fact ought never to be lost sight of in a fair appreciation of
the literary efforts of the Hungarians.

Literature being a nation in words, as history is a nation in deeds, it
would be impossible to grasp the drift, or value the achievements of
Hungarian Literature without some knowledge of the Magyar nation in the
past and in the present. It may be therefore advisable to premise a few
remarks on Hungary and her history before entering on a narrative of
Hungarian Literature.




CHAPTER II.


Hungary, in extent larger than the United Kingdom, is, geographically
speaking, one large basin, watered by one large river and its affluents,
and bounded by one imposing range of mountains. The river is called
the Danube, the mountains are the Carpathian offshoots of the Alps.
This geographical unity makes Hungary almost predestined to be the seat
of one nation. The natural unity calls for, it may be presumed, the
national. Yet the very richness of the soil, diversified as it is by
the vegetable and mineral wealth of huge mountains, and the cereal and
animal exuberance of vast plains has, in all times, attracted numerous
tribes from eastern Europe and western and central Asia to the country
of the “blue” Danube, and the “blonde” Theiss. Some of these invaders
succeeded for a time in establishing a kind of dominion over parts of
Hungary. Thus the Huns in the fifth, the Gepidae in the fifth and sixth,
the Avars in the seventh and eighth, numerous Slav tribes in the eighth
and ninth centuries were successively lords of the plains and some
mountainous parts of Hungary. Not one of these peoples, however, could
either maintain themselves as rulers, or quite disappear as dwellers.
Already in the ninth century we find Hungary inhabited by more than
fifteen different nations or portions of nations, offering then the
same gorgeous medley of Humanity that is still so characteristic of the
country. Where the above nations failed, the Magyars signally succeeded.
They and they alone of all the numerous, if not perhaps innumerable
nations that had tried to rear a lasting polity on the columns of the
Carpathians, and behind the moats of the Danube; the Hungarians alone,
we say, succeeded in establishing themselves as the permanent rulers
of the Slav and Turanian peoples of Hungary, and as the members of a
state endowed with abiding forces of order within and power without.
From 996 to 1301 A.D., they took their dukes and kings from the family
of the Árpáds, under whom they had entered (some 100,000 men, women,
and children) the country. Saint Stephen (the first canonized king)
consolidated their constitution. Without attempting to overrate the value
of constitutions either grown or made, and, while laying due stress on
that _geometria situs_, or providential strategy in the location of
nations which has perhaps wrought the major part of History, it is
tolerably certain, that the constitution of Hungary, as developed under
the Árpád dynasty, and as still surviving in some of its essential
elements, has had a most beneficial influence on the public life of the
Magyars. Like that of England, it combines the excellency of the Latin
system of centralization, with the advantages of the Germanic custom of
local autonomy.

Already in the early middle ages, Hungary was divided into counties
endowed with selfgovernment. At the same time there was a centre of
government and legislation in the national assembly or diet, where king
and subjects met to discuss the affairs affecting the peace or wars of
the entire state. In 1222, or seven years after Magna Charta was signed
at Runnymede, the Hungarians forced their King John, whose name was
Andrew II., to sign the Golden Bull, which, like the English Charter,
was to be the text of the country’s constitution, all subsequent laws
being in the nature of commentaries on that text. The elements of the
Hungarian and English constitution being nearly alike, the domestic
histories of the two nations bear, up to the sixteenth century, striking
resemblance to one another. We learn of wars of the “barons” against the
king, such as those under Henry III. and Henry IV. in England; we read
of the constant struggles of the “commons” (in Hungary consisting of the
lower nobility, that is, of knights as distinguished from burgesses),
for broader recognition of their parliamentary rights; of rebellions,
like that of Wat the Tyler, of the peasants against their oppressors, the
landed gentry; and of fierce dynastic struggles, like the Wars of the
Roses. But while these historic parallels may be found in many another
country of mediæval Europe with its remarkable homogeneity of structure,
the distinctive parallelism between England and Hungary is in the
tenacity with which the ruling people of both countries have carried over
their autonomous institutions from the times before the Reformation to
the sixteenth and the following centuries, or to the period of Absolutism
sweeping over Europe ever since Luther had raised his voice for religious
liberty.

All nations of Europe had constitutions more or less similar to that
of England during the Middle Ages; for there was after all a very
considerable amount of Liberty extant in mediæval institutions. But at
the threshold of the sixteenth century, when new worlds were discovered
by the genius and daring of the Portuguese and the Italians, the better
part of the old world, that is, its Liberty, was completely lost, and
sovereigns became absolute and peoples slaves. Three nations alone
amongst the larger states remained unaffected by the plague of absolutism
then spreading over Europe; they alone preserving intact the great
principles of local autonomy, central parliaments, and limited power of
the Crown. These were the English, the Poles and the Hungarians. In these
three countries alone there was practically no dead past as against a
presumptuous present. The nation’s past was still living in the shape of
actual realities, and the growth of the constitution was, in spite of
all sudden ruptures and breaks, continuous and organic. What the Stuarts
were to England, the Habsburgs were to Hungary during the seventeenth
century. Hence in both countries we notice continual rebellions and wars,
both parliamentary and other. The Stuarts, however, were little aided by
foreign powers in their attempts at crushing the autonomous rights of the
English nation. On the contrary, one of the greatest statesmen of modern
times, William of Orange, came, and with him several great powers of
Europe, to the rescue of the people of England; and thus the end of the
seventeenth century was also the termination of Absolutism in England.
In Hungary it was the grave of Liberty. The Hungarian Stuarts, or the
then Habsburgs, far from being deserted by the other Great Powers of
Europe, were most efficiently abetted by them. This happened of course
in a way apparently quite alien to any desire to destroy the liberties
of Hungary. Vienna, the capital of the Habsburgs, was, in 1683, besieged
by the hitherto fairly invincible Turks, and Austria was menaced with
utter ruin. The war being, on the face of it, a crusade, the Christian
powers, and, chiefly, fat and gallant John Sobieski, King of Poland,
came to the succour of Leopold of Austria. The Turk was beaten, and not
only out of Austria, but also out of Hungary, where he had been holding
two-thirds of the counties for over one hundred and fifty years. Hungary
was almost entirely liberated from her Mahometan oppressor, and, such
is the illogicality of History, for the very same reason nearly lost
her autonomous existence. For the evil of foreign saviours now told on
the Magyars. Had they driven back the Turk by their own efforts, the
result would have been an unprecedented electrization and stimulation
of all the forces of the nation. The Greeks after Salamis; the Romans
after Zama; the English after Trafalgar had won not only a victory over
an enemy, but an immeasurably increased vitality fraught with novel
energies. The Hungarians after the capture of Buda and the Battle of
Zenta, both achieved by Austria’s foreign allies and foreign generals,
had defeated the Turks indeed; but their own ends too. Never was Hungary
in a lower state of national stagnation than shortly after the peace of
Carlovitz (1699), which put a formal end to Turkish rule in most of the
Hungarian counties. Prince Francis Rákóczy II., who started the last
of the Great Rebellions of the Magyars previous to 1848, and after the
above peace, found no Holland rich in capital, no Brandenburg ready to
hand with well-trained regiments, no Austria willing to avert side-blows
from enemies, to help him in the manner in which the asthmatic Prince
of Orange was helped against James II. and his powerful abettor. And
when Rákóczy too had expended his forces in vain, Hungary fell into
a decrepitude but too natural in a nation whose foreign foe had been
conquered by its domestic oppressor.

The political bankruptcy of the Hungarians by the beginning of the
eighteenth century is of such importance for the study of the history of
their literature, that we cannot but attempt to search for some of the
reasons and causes of this national disaster. The principal cause was, it
would seem, the lack of that very class of citizens which had in England
so potently contributed to the ultimate victory of popular freedom—the
middle class. Hungary never recognized, nor tolerated the complicated
maze of semi-public and semi-private institutions collectively called
Feudalism. Whatever the merits or demerits of that mediæval fabric may or
may not have been, it is certain that the rise of the _bourgeois_ class
is owing directly, and still more indirectly to the action and re-action
of Feudalism. The parallelism between England Poland, and Hungary pointed
out above, must now be supplemented by the statement, that England alone
of these three commonwealths had, through the invasion and conquests of
the French Normans, received a large infusion of feudal institutions,
and that therefore England alone was to create that powerful class of
burgesses and yeomen, which was entirely lacking in both Poland and
Hungary. Without such a class of “mean” citizens no modern nation has
been able to consolidate its polity; and Hungary in the seventeenth
century, being totally devoid of such a class, was in the long run bound
to be wrecked by such a deficiency. We shall see how heavily the absence
of a middle class told on the growth of Hungarian Literature.

During the eighteenth century and up to 1815, the great and scarcely
interrupted wars of the Habsburgs enlisted all the powers of Hungary. In
1741 the Magyars, and they alone, saved Austria from what seemed to be
inevitable dismemberment. From that date onward to the campaign of 1788
the History of Hungary is but a chapter in that of Austria. Towards
that latter date the wave of Nationalism started in France had reached
Hungary. Like the Belgians and the Czechs (Bohemians), the Hungarians too
began to revolt from the anti-nationalist and _egalitarian_ autocracy
of Emperor Joseph II., one of the characteristic geniuses of the last
century, who was exceedingly enlightened on everything else but his own
business. The old Magyar institutions, and weightiest amongst them, the
Magyar language was, by the Hungarian diet, alas! not by the Hungarian
people, decreed to be the public language of the country. Resistance
to Joseph’s “reforms” became so serious, as to prevail upon the dying
monarch to revoke them, 1790; and under his successor, Leopold II.,
1790-1792, who was of a less aggressive temper, Hungarian nationality
seemed to approach its revival. This was, however, not to be.

The French Revolution, although essentially a nationalist movement,
forwarded in Europe outside France, for nearly two generations after
its rise, none but the cause of the monarchs. The Hungarians, who
gave Austria many of her best generals, and fought in nearly all the
battles of the Revolutionary Wars from 1792 to 1815, were in the end
shorn of all their hopes and expectations by the successful fop who
directed Austria’s policy from 1809 to 1848. Prince Metternich had not
the faintest conception of the rights or wants of the Hungarians; and
having brought to fall, as he thought he did, the French Revolution and
its personification, Napoleon Buonaparte, he could not but think that
a small nation, as the Hungarians, would speedily and lastingly yield
to high-handed police regulations, to gagging the public conscience,
and to unmanning the press. The year 1848 witnessed the final victory
of the French Revolution all over Europe. Hungary, foremost amongst
the countries where oppressed nations were demolishing the bulwarks of
tyranny, freed herself from the yoke of Austrian ministers. The Austrian
armies were driven out of Hungary; the Habsburgs were declared to have
forfeited the crown of St. Stephen; and but for the help of Russia, the
Austrian monarchs would have been deprived of more than one half of their
empire. When a now nameless Hungarian general surrendered to the Russians
at Világos (1849), Hungary was bodily incorporated with the Austrian
Empire, and Czech and Austrian officials were sent down to germanize
and denationalize Hungary. In 1860 the reaction set in. The nation,
offering a passive resistance of a most formidable character, brought the
Vienna Cabinet to its senses; and when, at Königsgrätz (July, 1866), the
Prussians had routed the armies of Austria, Hungary’s greatest political
sage, Francis Deák, aided by the Austrian minister, Count Beust,
restored the ancient Magyar autonomy and independence. Ever since (1867)
Hungary’s relation to Austria has been that of confederation for purposes
of foreign policy, and absolute independence for the work of domestic
rule. The Emperor of Austria is at the same time the King of Hungary;
and thus the two halves of the Empire are united by a personal link. Law
and its administration; Parliament and municipal government; commerce
and trade; in short, all that goes to form the life of a separate nation
is, in Hungary, of as independent a character as it is in Austria. A
Hungarian must, like any other foreigner, be formally naturalized in
order that he may be considered an Austrian citizen, and _vice versâ_.




CHAPTER III.


The preceding short survey of the history of Hungary may now be followed
by a brief sketch of the character and temper of the Hungarians. The
Magyar proper, and all the numerous individuals in Hungary who have
become completely assimilated to and by the Magyar element, bear in
character much similarity to the Poles on the one hand, and to the
Spanish on the other. They are rhapsodic and enthusiastic; excellent
orators and improvisators; and most sensitive as to their personal
dignity and social respect. As their music so their character is written
in passionate rhythms, moving from broad and majestic _largo_ to quick
and highly accentuated _presto_. Yet Hungarians, unlike Poles and
Spaniards, do not let their rhapsodic impetus run away with them, and
they have shown on all great occasions of their history, much coolness
and firmness of judgment. Nor do they exaggerate their sense of dignity
into bloated _grandezza_. They are rather humorous than witty; yet in
a country replete with so many idioms and peoples, there may be found
curious borderlands of pun, wit, and humour. Passionately fond of music
and dancing, to both of which the Hungarians have given a peculiar
artistic development of their own, the Magyars have seldom manifested
remarkable talent for architecture. Painting and sculpture have found
many an able devotee in Hungary.

But it is in music that most artists of Hungary have excelled. Hungary
is saturated with music. No student of Magyar literature can afford to
neglect the study of Magyar music. The parallelism between the growth
of Hungarian music and Hungarian Literature is not so complete, as that
between German music and German literature. Yet nothing will furnish
us an ampler commentary on Magyar lyrics or epic poetry, than that
magnificent music which has inspired heroes on the battlefield, lovers
in their closets, Bach and Beethoven in their studies alike. It is
intense music of torrential and meteoric beauties, and a bewildering
bass. Strange to say, Bach’s preludes _à la fantasia_ come nearest in
character to the original Hungarian music, as played in the wayside inns
of the immense _puszta_, or Plain of Hungary. In Hungary, all musical
performances at social gatherings are entrusted to the gypsies, who
undoubtedly added much outward ornament and characteristic _fioriture_
to the melodies and harmonies of the Hungarian people; yet the body and
soul of that music are thoroughly Hungarian. Music in Hungary is the
vocal and instrumental folk-lore of the people; and no lyrical poet
of the Magyars could help writing without having in view the musical
adaptation of his poem. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that
the continual indulgence in music has had its serious drawbacks. In a
measure, music is the opium of Hungary. It fosters but too much that
bent for dreamy idleness, which is the chief failing in the Hungarian
character. Much has been done in recent times to inspirit the slumbering
energies of the nation not only in the high walks of public life, but
also in the lowly avenues of industrial, commercial, and other less
picturesque activity. Still more remains to be done.

The lack of a middle class, or _bourgeois_ proper, has retarded the
growth of literature no less than that of political independence. Within
recent times there were only two classes of Hungarians in Hungary,
nobles and peasants. The floating and unassimilated portion of the
population between these two classes remained either quite alien to
Hungarian aspirations, or it attempted to imitate the nobles, of course
chiefly in their less commendable qualities. The undeniable indolence
of the small nobleman, or country-squire; his aversion to town-life;
his abhorrence of trades and crafts; all these and similar shortcomings
inherent in a caste of nobles had a baneful influence on their numerous
imitators. Literature is, as a rule, an urban growth. The urban element
in Hungary, however—was till the end of the last century of very
subordinate importance. The frequent social gatherings of the Hungarian
country gentlemen and their numerous imitators were indeed full of
spirited talk and engaging conversation. In what might be called the
_Parlature_ of a nation, or the aggregate of their private discussions,
dialogues, speeches, etc., the Hungarians are and always have been very
rich. Many a brilliant essay or novelette has been talked in Hungarian
drawing-rooms and dining-halls, which in other countries would have
made the fortune of a writer. In fact, there is little exaggeration in
advancing the statement that the literature of a nation is the complement
of its _parlature_; and where the latter is inordinately developed, the
former is necessarily of a less exuberant growth. This “law,” if so it
may be called, operated with much force in a country where it is far
easier to find listeners than readers. It also accounts for much that
is characteristic of Hungarian prose. Like French literature, Hungarian
poetry or prose applies more to the ear than to the eye, and accordingly
suffers very much from translation. That rich _parlature_ in Hungary
has, however, another and still more serious drawback. Up to 1870, in
round numbers, there was in many parts of Hungary, more especially in
the north-west and north, a custom of using, in common conversation, two
or three idioms, almost at a time. Sentences were commenced in Latin,
continued in Hungarian, and wound up in German, or Slovak. The constant
use of several idioms, as it has rendered Hungarians peculiarly apt for
the acquisition of foreign languages, so it has made them more than apt
to read and assimilate foreign literatures. This again made many a less
enterprising mind hesitate, and likewise many a feeble mind but too prone
to imitate, especially the German writers, both in style and subject. The
originality of Hungarian authors was thus at times much impaired. In the
course of the present work we shall meet with several cases. At present
we must hasten to speak of the most potent of the factors of Hungarian
Literature; of the Hungarian language.




CHAPTER IV.


The Hungarian language is totally different in vocabulary and grammar
from the Teutonic, Latin, Slav, or Celtic languages. Between Russian
and German, or between Russian and English there is much affinity,
both groups of languages belonging to the Aryan, or Indo-German class
of idioms. Between Hungarian and German, or Hungarian and Slav, there
is no affinity whatever. The Hungarians have indeed inserted some
Slav and German mortar into crevices left open by an occasional decay
of the Hungarian material; but the structure and functions of the
Magyar language are totally alien to either Slav or German idioms.
It is an agglutinative language, the root of words being almost
invariably formed by their first syllables, unto which all affixes
and pronouns are soldered according to a fairly regular process of
word and case-formation. In Aryan languages the root is, as it were,
subterranean, and frequently hard to lay bare. In Hungarian the root is
always transparent. The vowels have a distinct musical value, and do not
resemble the musically indeterminable vowels or diphthongs of English
or German. Consonants are never unduly accumulated, as in Bohemian;
and strong accents on one syllable of a word are unknown. Generally,
the first syllable of the word has a heavier stress on it. Hungarian
is rich both in its actual vocabulary, especially for outward things
and phenomena, more especially still for acoustic phenomena; and in its
prospective word-treasury. In few languages can new words, expressing
shades and phases of meanings, be coined with greater ease. This facility
applies to abstract terms as well as to material ones. It is probably
not too much to say, that for purposes of Metaphysics or Psychology
few languages offer so ample a repository and laboratory for terms as
does the Magyar language. Although far from being as adapted for rhyme
as English or German, yet Hungarian has many and sonorous rhymes. On
the other hand, it crystallizes with readiness into all the metres of
Greek or Latin poetry. A peculiarity of Hungarian (and Finnish) are the
diminutives of endearment and affection.

The origin of the Hungarian language has been, and still is, a matter of
great discussion between the students of philology. It is certain that
Hungarian is not an Aryan, but an Ugor (Ugrian) language, belonging to
a vast group of languages spoken in parts of China, in Siberia, Central
Asia, Russia, and Turkey. We here adjoin the genealogy of the Hungarian
language as given by Professor Simonyi, of Budapest, who is considered
one of the greatest living authorities on the history and grammar of the
Magyar language. He says that Hungarian, together with Vogul, Ostiak,
Siryenian, Votiak, Lapp, Finnish, Mordvin, and Cseremiss (spoken in
the north and north-east of Russia) form the Ugrian language-group.
This group is closely akin to four other groups, viz., the Samojed; the
Turkish or Tartar; the Mongolian; and the Tungusian, or Mandchu groups.
These five large groups are called the Altaic languages, and are all
derived from an original Altaic idiom. Their mutual relations are shown
in the following diagram taken from Professor Simonyi’s work:

It will be seen that Hungarian is in near relation to Finnish and also
to Lapp, as had been recognized already by the Jesuit John Sajnovics
(1770), and proved by the great traveller, Anton Reguly. It is,
however, also related to Turkish; and this explains why the leading
neo-philologists of Hungary (Budenz, Paul Hunfalvy, and Arminius Vámbéry)
are, the two former in favour of a Finnish, the latter in favour of a
Turkish origin and kinship of both the Hungarians and their language.
Amongst the numerous students of that vexed question, no one has done
more to excite the admiration of his compatriots and foreigners, and the
applause of scholars, than Alexander Csoma de Kőrős, who sacrificed his
life in the monasteries of Thibet in the noble attempt at discovering,
by the laborious acquisition of Central-Asiatic languages, the origin
of the Magyars. We confess that we entertain but scant sympathy for the
belief in races and racial persistency. Wherever the Hungarians may have
come from, and whether or no every one living Hungarian can trace his
descent to one of the clans invading Hungary at the close of the ninth
century is, in our opinion, immaterial. As a matter of fact, very few
Magyar noblemen can trace their family beyond the year of the battle of
Mohács (1526). It is quite different with the language of the Hungarians.
Its origin and character are, on the whole, pretty clear, and from the
knowledge of its relations to kindred idioms, many a valuable conclusion
may be drawn regarding the rise and nature of Hungarian Literature in the
past and in the present. The greatest patriot of Hungary, Count Stephen
Széchenyi, has tersely expressed the immense influence of language on
the nation in the words: “Language carries the nation away with it.” Our
whole view of Hungarian Literature would be different if for instance the
opinion of erudite Matthew Bél (Belius) as to the Hebrew origin of the
Hungarian language had proved to be true. It would likewise essentially
alter our conception of Magyar literary works if the opinion of
Podhorszky as to the close relation between Hungarian and Chinese would
not have been found untenable. But the physical origin of the Hungarians
themselves is, at best, only an idle inquiry into insufficient records of
the past.




CHAPTER V.


                                                               896-1520.

The history of Hungarian Literature is divided into four distinct
periods. The first comprises the time from the advent of the Magyars in
Hungary to the Reformation (896-1520); the second, from the Reformation
to the peace of Szathmár, or the termination and failure of Hungary’s
revolt from Austria (1520-1711); the third, from 1711 to 1772, or the
period of stagnation; and finally from 1772 to our own days, or the
period of the full development.

896-1520. The first period is exceedingly poor in written remains of
literature. In fact, the first and thus the oldest literary relic of
the Hungarian language is a short “Funeral Sermon” (_Halotti Beszéd_),
dating from the first third of the thirteenth century; and for 200 years
after that date, we meet, with the exception of a Hungarian glossary of
the year 1400, recently discovered at Schlaegl, in Upper Austria, with
no example of a Hungarian literary work of even slight extent. From the
middle of the fifteenth century we possess a fragment, called after
the town where it was discovered, by Dr. Julius Zacher in 1862, the
“_Königsberg_ (in Prussia) _Fragment_.” Thus, the number of extant, or
hitherto discovered Hungarian works of even slight literary merit is,
down to 1450 A.D., an almost negligible quantity. Mr. Szilády in his
“Collection of Ancient Hungarian Poets” (_Régi Magyar Költők Tára_) has
indeed communicated six and fifty mediæval Hungarian church-poems and
other fragments; but of that number scarcely a dozen are original poems,
the rest being mere translations of the then current church-poetry. The
philologist may no doubt find much to glean from even this scant harvest
of Hungarian Literature in the first period. For literature proper, it
is of no account whatever. Yet it would be unfair to leave this period
without even a passing mention of its oral literature, or epic and
legendary stories, of which there must have been no small quantity in
those agitated times.

The Hungarian naïve epic is lost. A glance at the habits of the Finns
will, however, suffice to satisfy the inquirer that the Hungarians, like
their cousins in Russia, must have cultivated the art of recitation and
oral handing down of the glorious deeds of their ancestors, to no small
extent. We now know that the immense epic of the Finns, the _Kalevala_,
has been transmitted from generation to generation by bards who had
treasured up in their memories the endless _runot_ recording the deeds
of Lemminkäinen, Väinämöinen, and Jlmarinen. The Hungarians, too, had
their bards, called _igrigeczek_, or _hegedősök_ (violinists); and at
the manors of the nobles or the courts of the kings, old heroic songs
were recited about Attila, King of the Huns; his brother, Bleda; the
fearful battle on the Catalaunian fields (Chalons-sur-Marne, 451 A.D.);
the building of the castle of Buda; the siege of Aquileia; and the last
fatal wedding of the terrible Hun. These Hun epics were widely known and
recited in mediæval Hungary, as witnessed by the chronicles of those
times. The people firmly believed themselves to be the successors of
Attila’s hordes, and this belief, although absolutely discountenanced by
modern historians, is still lingering in the spinning-halls of Hungarian
villages, and in lecture halls in England and America.

The circle of those oral epics comprised also the Magyar heroes proper.
There were stories about Álmos, father of Árpád, the conqueror of
Hungary; others about the “Seven Magyars” (_Hét Magyar_); the conquest
of Transylvania by doughty Tuhutum, one of Árpád’s generals; the flight
of King Zalán, defeated by Árpád; the exploits of valiant Botond, Lehel
(the Hungarian Roland), Bölscü, and other paladins of Árpád’s times, etc.
In the fragments from Priscus, the Byzantine rhetorician and historian;
in the chronicles of Ekkehard, the monk of St. Gallen; and in the
“Anonymus,” or one of the chief, but hitherto, fatherless chronicles of
Hungary, the above and some more heroic stories and epical records may be
found.

In addition to the heroic epic, the Hungarians, like all the rest of the
Christian nations of the west, had a considerable tradition of legends
and lives of saints. Fortunately for Hungary, it had become, by the end
of the tenth century of our era, both the hierarchical and political
interest of one of the most learned and most statesmanlike of the popes,
Sylvester II., to detach Hungary completely from the Eastern, or Greek
Church; and to adopt it, by sending a royal crown to Stephen, duke of the
Hungarians, into the world of Roman Catholicism. Had Hungary joined the
Eastern Church, it could never have withstood the ambition and supremacy
of the German Emperors, aided by the Popes of Rome. Having, however,
adopted the Roman, or progressive form of Christianity, Hungary was
endowed with occidental or richer seedlings of civilization. St. Mary
was made the patroness of Hungary; and all through the Middle Ages, she
was adored and glorified in legends and songs. Some of these Hungarian
legends about the Virgin Mary we still possess; likewise, the life of St.
Margit, the daughter of King Béla IV.; the famous story of Josaphat and
Barlaam, one of the most popular of mediæval Christian legends, taken
originally from Indian (Buddhistic) sources; the life of St. Catherine of
Alexandria, etc. The most characteristically Hungarian of these legends
is, as to its subject, the life of St. Margit. As to its literary merits,
it is, alas! a dry chronicle without any charm of form or diction at all.
Nor did the Hungarians, as far as we know, succeed in throwing one or
another of their crusading heroes into strong epic relief. The crusaders,
in spite of their marvellous deeds, lent themselves far more to good
chronicling than to epics. Their inherent poetic vice of being, or trying
to be, saints rather than heroes rendered them unfit for real epics.




CHAPTER VI.


                                                               1520-1711.

1520-1711. The Reformation made rapid headway in Hungary. From the very
beginning, Protestantism in Hungary had a political element, in that its
rise was coeval with the accession of the Catholic Austrian dynasty so
unwelcome to many Hungarians. Theological and political opposition thus
gave a more than ordinary impetus to the study of all the questions and
problems agitated during the Reformation. The most prominent result of
that movement was a revival of the national feeling; and coupled with
that, a regeneration of Hungarian Literature. The vast intellectual
revolution of the fifteenth century, commonly called the Renascence,
had, of course, left its traces in Hungary too. One of the most popular
of Magyar Kings, Matthew Corvinus (1458-1490), invited a number of
Italian scholars and artists to Hungary, such as Anton Bonfini, of Ascoli
(1427-1503), Marzio Galeotto, of Narni, in Umbria (1427(?)-1497), Peter
Ranzanus, of Palermo; Thaddeus Ugoletus, of Parma; Bartholinus Fontius;
Felix of Ragusa; etc.

These scholars and artists, ably assisted by the Hungarian John Cesinge,
or Janus Pannonius (1432-1472), and chiefly by the generous and refined
king himself, brought some new leaven into the stagnant intellectual
life of Hungary. In addition to the university founded by King Lewis the
Great, at Pécs (1367), a new university was founded at Pozsony, where
the Danube enters Hungary; the king’s famous library (the _Corvina_)
became the delight of scholars; and a printing press was established
at Buda (1473). The king’s victorious campaigns against the Hussites
(see Jósika’s novel, “_The Bohemians in Hungary_”), the Turks and the
Austrians, gave rise to numerous poems and songs composed by unknown
poets; and his age, called the Age of the Hunyadis, the king being a
Hunyadi, bade fair to be one of great intellectual brilliancy too.
However Matthew’s premature death and the ensuing political troubles put
an end to such prospects. It was left for the passions roused by the
Reformation to kindle the fire which the torch of the Renascence had been
unable to light. In all the countries where the deep influence of the
Renascence preceded that of the Reformation, the intellectual capital of
the country was not impaired, even when its political was. In Hungary,
the Renascence left too slender traces to guard the nation from falling
into lawless writing about the topics of the day, regardless of the
rules and classical measure so deeply impressed by the Renascence on the
more fortunate nations of Italy, Spain, France and England. Hence the
immense mental and emotional stir imparted by the Reformation was not
sufficient to raise up great writers in Hungary. In fact, Hungary was,
on a smaller scale, in a mental condition exactly similar to that of
Germany. There too the Renascence had scarcely begun to do its beneficial
work, when the Reformation swept everything before it. The consequence
was the same. Luther himself, although one of the geniuses of language;
Fischart, a very demon of language; and Hutten, the great champion of
thought and liberty, together with numerous minor lights, were, in spite
of efforts without number, debarred from creating a great German national
literature. It was only much later, when the Renascence had done its work
in Germany too, that the Germans, following in the wake of the Greeks,
Romans, French, English, Spanish and Italians, were able to create a
great national literature of their own. The same remark holds good for
Hungary too.

Protestantism in Hungary assumed all the aspects it had taken in
Germany and Switzerland. There were Lutherans proper, and Calvinists;
Anabaptists and Unitarians. The Geneva of Hungary was the town of the
“_cives_,” Debreczen, east of the middle Theiss, in a large plain.
Melius, or Peter Juhász (1536-1572) was the “pope” of the Magyar
Calvinists; as Matthew Biró de Déva, 1500(?)-1545, was that of the
Lutherans. Both preached in Hungarian and published a number of doctrinal
and controversial writings in Hungarian; and both were followed by
many a writer whose enthusiasm was the better part of his ability. The
Bible, portions of which had been translated into Hungarian before the
Reformation, was now published in Magyar in its entirety. This most
excellent translation, executed chiefly by Caspar Károlyi, was printed at
Vizsoly, in the county of Abauj.

The number of Hungarian poets writing in Hungarian during the sixteenth
century is more than one hundred; most of them being Protestants. In the
first years of the Reformation, their works were mostly of a religious
character, such as psalms and prayers. Amongst these we may mention the
religious poems of Andreas Batizi, Matthew Biró, and Gál Huszár. The
constant wars with the Turks or infidels added a peculiar intensity to
the religious passions of the time; and accordingly the first Hungarian
drama, “The Marriage of Priests” (_A papok házassága_), published
in Cracow (then belonging to Poland) in 1550, and written by Michael
Sztárai, was in reality an exposition of Protestantism in the form of a
drama. “Moralities,” and mordant satires against priests and the Catholic
Church generally, were frequent. Didactic poetry, so closely allied with
the moralizing spirit of early Protestantism, was ably represented by
Gabriel Pesti, whose translation of Æsop’s “Fables” appeared in 1536
(in Vienna); and by Caspar Heltai, who likewise translated fables from
ancient authors, 1566.

From the second half of the sixteenth century we possess a great number
of rhymed stories, taken from the Bible, from foreign novels or from
Hungarian history. One of the most famous of the authors of such stories
was Sebastian Tinódy, whose “_Chronicle_,” or poetical narrative of
contemporary events appeared in Kolozsvár, in Transylvania, in 1554.
As a poetical work it is scarcely of any value, with the exception of
the music accompanying it. As a faithful picture of the Hungary of that
time it will continue to be valuable to the patriot and historian. The
language is heavy; the form is unshapely. In some respects superior to
Tinódy were Stephen Temesváry and Matthew Nagy de Bánka; the latter
being the bard of the great John Hunyadi. One, Albert Gergei, of whose
personal circumstances nothing is known, composed, chiefly from Italian
sources, the story of a young prince fighting innumerable foes and
surmounting difficulties of all sorts in search of the fairy whom he,
in the end, does not fail to win. This story (“_Argirius Királyfi_”)
has ever since the sixteenth century been the most popular chap-book
amongst the lower classes in Hungary. Its _naïveté_ and good epic tone
render it agreeable even to a more cultured taste. Another poet of the
second half of the sixteenth century, Peter İlosvai, composed, probably
from the floating folk-poetry of his age, a poetical narrative of the
life of Nicolas Toldy, one of the most popular heroes of the Magyars,
who lived in the fourteenth century, under King Lewis the Great, and was
of Herculean strength. His feats are sung in İlosvai’s poem (published
at Debreczen in 1574) in an effective, if rough, manner. A number of
Magyar novels may also be found; but nearly all were translations from
German or Latin novels of the time. The sixteenth century produced even
a few Magyar works of historic and philologic character. John Erdősi,
or Sylvester, wrote the first grammar of the Magyar language (1539);
Gabriel Pesti gave, in 1538, a short dictionary of the Magyar language;
John Decsi de Baranya published in 1588 a collection of about 5,000
Magyar proverbs; Stephen Székely de Bencéd and Caspar Heltai published
“World-Chronicles,” in 1559 and 1575 respectively. Very many memoirs and
journals of that time are still unpublished.

We must now mention the greatest of all the Hungarian poets of the
sixteenth century, whose name we have so far left unnoticed because, by
one of the strange freaks of life, the manuscripts of his lyrical poems,
on which rests his great fame among Magyar poets, were first discovered
only twenty-four years ago (in 1874), and some of them even after that
date, and were therefore never largely known to the contemporaries of
their author. This poet is Baron Valentin Balassi (1551-1594). He came
from a magnate family, and so great were the gifts with which nature
had endowed him, that men praised him as a model of heroism, and women
worshipped him as the embodiment of chivalrous charm. In the troubles
of his time, both political and social, he took more than one part; and
he may be considered as at once the Knight Errant and the Parsifal of
Hungary in the latter half of the sixteenth century. Highly cultivated
and sensitive as he was, he could not but respond to the religious
impulses of his time, and so became the author of many a religious poem.
On his wanderings, which took him not only over the whole of his own
country, but even as far as North Germany and probably also to England,
he saw all forms and aspects of life. His lyric sentiments he embodied
in the so-called “Flower Songs” (“_Virág-énekek_”), which are full of
that _verve_ and sweetness so characteristic of the best lyric poets
of Hungary. He also introduced a new form of lyric stanza—the Balassi
Stanza—which consists of nine short lines, the end-rhymes of which are
the same in the third, sixth, and ninth lines, while the remaining three
couples, have each their own rhymes.




CHAPTER VII.


                                                               1520-1711.

During the seventeenth century Hungary was oppressed by two evils of
apparently antagonistic character; either of which, however, was to have
the same fatal effect on Hungarian Literature. On the one hand, nearly
two-thirds of Hungary proper, as apart from Transylvania, was under
Turkish rule; on the other, the Habsburgs, then at their apogee, waged a
relentless war against the liberties and independence of the Hungarians
both in non-Turkish Hungary and in Transylvania. In the latter country,
the Bocskays, Bethlens, and Rákóczys had in succession contrived to
establish a Hungarian principate which, although acknowledging Turkish
ascendancy, yet retained many of the rights of sovereignty. These two
sets of circumstances were in themselves hurtful to the development
of anything relating to Hungarian nationality, and most of all to
Hungarian Literature. The counties under Turkish rule could not, by the
very nature of the oppression under which they smarted, produce any
literary movement at all. The counties under Austrian rule were held in
bondage both political and intellectual, which stifled all attempts at a
national literature. The sages have as yet not been able to prove, that
a republican government must of necessity be beneficial to the material
and political welfare of a nation. As to the intellectual progress
of a nation, on the other hand, Liberty is generally taken to be an
indispensable condition. Literature is possible only where there is at
least a republic of minds. The Austrian government took good precautions
to render the rise of such a republic in Hungary an impossibility. All
the higher and middle schools in Austrian Hungary were, during the
seventeenth century, in the hands of the Jesuits. The order of Jesus
has not, as is well known, prevented a very great number of its members
and pupils from rising to eminence in Theology and in Science. It could
not, owing to its cosmopolitan and anti-national constitution, further
movements of national literature. Quite apart from the debatable nature
of its moral and political teachings, it retarded or stopped all such
movements by employing in its schools the Latin language as the vehicle
of instruction. At Nagyszombat (in 1635); at Kassa (in 1657); at Buda (in
1687), the Jesuits founded, or taught in, universities, where lectures
on all branches of knowledge were delivered in the mongrel language of
the mediæval Scholastics, which has always had a baneful influence both
on knowledge and its students. In the Protestant schools, the number of
which exceeded seven hundred and fifty, the same radically false system
was observed. The consequence was, that the vast majority of Hungarians
had never received a living knowledge of either the history of Man or of
Nature, and could accordingly turn their dead intellectual capital to no
account. The only Hungarians whose mental acquirements had sufficient
vitality to serve as stimulants to literary production of a higher type
were such as could read Italian or French, that is, works, written in
one, and thus fertilizing another living language. Such exceptional
individuals could then be found only amongst the wealthy classes, or
in other words, amongst the magnates. Thus it happened that all great
literary work in Hungarian produced during the seventeenth century was
done by the great noblemen, and by them alone. Hungary may therefore
afford a fair test for the curious problem, whether from an aristocracy
of birth can be recruited that aristocracy of genius the work of which
forms a nation’s great literature. In Hungary, the aristocracy of birth
proved, on the whole, unequal to such a task. The Hungarian magnates of
the seventeenth century did much creditable work in _belles-lettres_, and
some also in graver departments of literature. Yet, they were unable to
originate more than a temporary and inferior reform; and, moreover, they
did, as we shall see, serious harm to the literary life of the nation at
large, in that they were not able to engage its interests in the growth
of its literature.

Of these magnates, the eloquent Cardinal Primate of Hungary, Peter
Pázmány (1570-1637), Archbishop of Esztergom, claims our attention
first. In his thirteenth year he became a convert to Catholicism,
and later a Jesuit; and so intense was his zeal for the Church of
Rome, that most of his active life was spent in a propaganda, by
writings even more than by words, for his church, and with a constant
literary warfare with the non-Catholics of Hungary. He is said to have
converted no less than thirty of the noblest families of his country
to the Catholic persuasion. At his time, perhaps the greatest number
of Protestants were in Transylvania, whose princes were warm-hearted
protectors of the Reformation; and since they cultivated the Hungarian
language in preference to any other, Pázmány thought it wise to use
the same idiom in his controversial writings. Pázmány’s theological
armoury is taken chiefly from the controversial works of his French
colleague and contemporary, the famous Jesuit Bellarmin. In his style,
however, he shows considerable originality. He prefers the strong, racy
expressions, proverbs and similes of the common people. His is a direct
and vigorous, rather than an artistic style. The strange contrast between
his popular vocabulary and the scholastic fence of his thoughts lends a
peculiar flavour to his _Hodegus_ or “_Kalauz_” (1613), and his sermons
(“_Prédikácziók_,” 1636). Among his numerous Protestant opponents were:
Peter Alvinczi, of Kassa; and George Komáromi Csipkés, of Debreczen;
the latter translated the whole Bible into Hungarian. As a sad contrast
to the splendid career of the convert Pázmány, we may mention here the
life-long sufferings and wanderings of the loyal Protestant Albert Molnár
de Szencz (1574-1634), who was persecuted wherever he came, in Germany,
Austria, Hungary or Transylvania; and who, one of the true epigones of
the Conrad Gesners and Sylburgs, published, in the midst of poverty
and misery, Hungarian dictionaries; a valuable Hungarian translation
of the Psalms (1607, after French models), which is in use to the
present day; a Hungarian Grammar (1610); and a Hungarian translation of
Calvin’s _Institutio_. Finally, the gorgeous picture of the Cardinal
cannot be set off to more advantage, than by a slight mention of the
fanatic and obscure _Sabbatarians_ (“_Szombatosok_”), in the background,
whose religious poetry is no uninteresting evidence of the Hungarian
theological literature of that time.

Amongst the numerous _protégés_ and pupils of the victorious archbishop
we find also Count Michael Zrinyi (1618-1664), a descendant of the famous
Zrinyi, who, in 1566, defied single-handed the invasion of Sultan Soliman
the Splendid, by offering him, with a handful of men, unconquerable
resistance in the Castle of Szigeth, some twenty miles west of Pécs.
Count Michael was one of the best educated men of his time, and equally
great as a patriot, poet and general. The sad state of Hungary could
not but affect deeply a man, whose historic _rôle_ seemed to be clearly
indicated by the glorious heroism of his ancestor. Having travelled
abroad, especially in Italy, where Tasso’s religious epic _Gerusalemme
liberata_ was read then more than ever after, he conceived the idea of
stirring up a vast crusade against the Turks, by singing the deeds of
his great-grandfather in an epic at once political and religious. This
epic is commonly called the “Zrinyiad” (“_Zrinyiász_”), and consists
of fifteen cantos, written in rugged and rough style. It reveals much
power of description and religious enthusiasm; but it is lacking in
form and moderation; nor can the portraits of its heroes be called
plastic by any means. It is, from the artistic standpoint, spoiled by
the deficiency above mentioned; the central hero is too perfect to
be lastingly interesting. Old Zrinyi is capital matter for ballads;
for an epic he is too faultless. On the other hand, the “Zrinyiad” is
one of the most effective of patriotic epics. Like the epic works of
Klopstock in Germany, or “_Ossian_” in England, it had at the time of its
appearance a great national value, apart from its literary merits. In
telling the Hungarian nation in tones of sacred anger, that the Turkish
oppression was due to the depravity of the Magyars, in exhorting them in
vigorous modes to rally and shake off the yoke of the infidels, Zrinyi
added an internal lustre to his work which even now, after more than
two centuries, has not lost much of its splendour. Like the daring and
glorious deed of his ancestor, his poem is more of a patriotic than an
historic event. It were only gross exaggeration to count the “Zrinyiad”
amongst the world’s great epics. The poet might well belie history in
letting his ancestor personally kill the great Sultan. It would be
dishonest to add to the glory of the poet by ignoring the truth of the
literary canon.

As to the other magnates who wrote poetical works in Hungarian during
the seventeenth century, it will be sufficient to say, that their poems
were meant chiefly for the gratification of their authors; and although
some of them were printed in book form, yet the bulk was left in the
well-deserved obscurity of family archives. The most noteworthy of these
poets were: John Rimay de Rima (1564-1631), an imitator of Balassi; Peter
Beniczky de Benicze (1606(?)-1664); Count Stephen Kohári (1649-1731);
Baroness Catherine Sidonia Petrőczi; Count Peter Zichy; Count Valentin
Balassi, the second poet of that name (1626(?)-1684); and Baron Ladislas
Listhy (1630-1660(?)), whose epic, “The Disaster of Mohács” (“_Mohács
veszedelme_”), betokens a remarkable talent for versification.

So exclusive was the influence of the magnates on the literature of that
time, that the one remarkable poet of the seventeenth century who was
no magnate himself, although a nobleman, selected as the subject of his
epic poem a romantic event from the life of one of the leading magnates.
Count Francis Wesselényi besieged, in 1644, the Castle of Murány,
defended by the beautiful widow, Mary Szécsi. In the end he won both
the heart of the heroic beauty and the castle. This famous event forms
the burden of one of the most popular of Hungarian poetical narratives,
briefly called, “The Venus of Murány” (“_Murányi Vénus_”, 1664), written
by Stephen Gyöngyössi. Its language is musical, and the narrative tone
very felicitous. The poet has evidently made a close study of Ovid,
and frequently reaches the light touch and charm of the Roman; he even
adds an element of romance, which has endeared his work to more than six
generations of Hungarian readers. The metre is Alexandrine.




CHAPTER VIII.


                                                               1520-1711.

Amidst the din and excitement of the endless wars in Hungary, both civil
and foreign, during the seventeenth century, the agitated mind of the
common people vented itself in numerous ditties, skits and lampoons,
which, after the name of one of the national parties, have been called
_Kurucz-poetry_. It consists almost exclusively of largely unprinted
little poems, mostly political, and depicts the agonies and torments
of the patriots. Some of them are good and true in tone, and even
powerful in the expression of hatred and satire. The one ever-memorable
folk-poem of that time, however, was not written in words. The profound
passions aroused by the last great revolution under the romantic Francis
Rákóczy II., towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of
the eighteenth century, were incarnated in inimitable fashion in the
“_Rákóczy march_,” the most fanaticising of all war-marches. Whoever
actually composed it (tradition ascribes it to a Hungarian gipsy-woman by
the name of Panna Czinka), that march spells a whole period of Hungarian
history, just as Milton’s _Paradise Lost_ spells a whole period of
English life. The Magyar nation was at the end of the seventeenth century
far too unpractised in literary architecture to rear its pangs and
longings into a dome of words. It was, however, then as now sufficiently
imbued with the power of musical creation, to embody its woes in the
fiery rhythms of the most heroic of martial songs.




CHAPTER IX.


                                                               1520-1711.

During the period in question very little was done for historic and
scientific studies. John Cséri de Apáca (1625-1660), an enthusiastic
student and patriot, published a small Hungarian “_Encyclopedia_”
(1655), in which the elements of knowledge, both philologic, natural and
mathematical are given in a simple and clear manner. Francis Páriz-Pápai
published a much used dictionary of the Hungarian and Latin languages
(1708). The nine books of the chronicle of John Szalárdi, who died 1666
(“_Siralmas Krónika_”), form the first attempt at historiography in the
Hungarian language. Some of the leading men of that age left memoirs; and
grammarians were also not wanting. The great philosophic wave, sweeping
over Europe in the seventeenth century (Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza,
Leibniz, Pierre Bayle), left scarcely any traces in Hungarian Literature,
except in Cséri’s Encyclopedia, where Cartesianism is not quite absent.




CHAPTER X.


                                                               1711-1772.

1711-1772. The period bounded by the years 1711-1772 is one of decline.
During these years, which comprise the reigns of Emperor Charles VI.,
and most of that of Austria’s greatest ruler, Maria Theresa (1740-1780),
there was practically very little Magyar literature; and the little
was bad. Hungarians of that period wrote, as a rule, in Latin; and the
subjects they selected were those of laborious erudition; philology;
descriptive natural science; annalistic history; historic theology. This
decline in national literature was only another phase of the decline
of the Magyar idiom. For, both in Transylvania, which was now again,
as formerly, united with Hungary, and in Hungary proper, the Hungarian
language ceased to be used in the schools, at the county-sessions,
in the law-courts, and in polite society. In all these centres of
intellectual intercourse, Latin, German or French were used instead
of the sonorous language of Árpád. In Catholic and Protestant schools
alike instruction was given in bad Latin. At the county-sessions; in
the national parliament; and in the law-courts, Latin alone was used;
while the higher classes of society were talking either in German or in
French. For the latter fact, there is a simple explanation at hand. When,
in 1711, Hungary was at last “pacified,” it had become evident to the
most patriotic of the leading families, that further armed resistance
to the Habsburgs being impossible, the only chances of promotion for
their children were at the court of Vienna. This involved the adoption
of Viennese manners, and Viennese mediums of conversation; that is,
of French and German. No sooner was that done by the aristocratic
families of Hungary, than the abnormal state of the then national
literature revealed all its latent barrenness. As has been seen in the
preceding chapters, all the great Hungarian writers from 1600 to 1711
were recruited from the class of the magnates. When, now, after 1711,
the magnates flocked to Vienna, there to undergo a thorough process of
Germanization, or rather Austrianization, there was no class of writers
left in Hungary to take their place. Hence the sudden dearth of great
writers, and the astounding decline of Hungarian Literature. To this
must be added the fact, that German literature which was naturally
destined to have a considerable influence on Hungarian writers, both
from geographical contiguity, and on account of the general knowledge
of German in the then Hungary; that German literature, we say, was not
beginning to reach its classical period before the sixties of that
century, and could therefore stimulate Hungarian Literature but very
little. It is much more difficult to account for the exclusive use
of Latin in the schools and in parliamentary debates. Had the use of
Latin in the schools been accompanied by the study of Greek and Greek
literature it would probably have wrought very much less mischief.

Unfortunately for Hungarian Literature, the study of Greek was almost
entirely neglected in the last century. _Graeca non leguntur._ The
immense power of æsthetic education inherent in Greek classical
works could thus not benefit the Hungarians. Nay, it may be said in
strict truth, that for Hungarians, naturally inclined as they are to
grandiloquence and redundancy, both of words and thought, the study of
Latin literature, untempered by that of Greek, was in many ways harmful.
Many Latin poets and prose-writers lack that simplicity and moderation,
which mark off Hellenic authors from all but the very best writers of
all ages. The exclusive study of Latin was therefore doubly harmful to
the Hungarians: first, in that it made them neglect their own language;
and secondly, in that it supplanted the study of Greek literature.
The exclusive use of Latin in all the schools and colleges of Hungary
during the last century was, however, part of that general obscurantism
weighing on all the educational institutions of the Habsburg empire.
Both Charles VI. and Maria Theresa left the instruction of youths in
the hands of monks and priests. Previous to the abolition of the order
of the Jesuits (1773) that order had no less than thirty “_gymnasia_,”
or higher colleges in Hungary. After its abolition, these colleges were
placed in the hands of other orders, such as the Præmonstratencians, the
Benedictines, Paulists and Franciscans. As in Austria, so in Hungary, the
regular clergy, more still than the secular, attempted to shut off their
pupils from the new light rising in France, England and Germany, and for
that purpose the habitual use of scholastic Latin was one of the most
efficient means. At the Protestant schools, of which the most famous were
at Debreczen, at Sárospatak, and at Pozsony, in Hungary proper; and at
Nagy Enyed, Kolosvár, Marosvásárhely, and at Udvarhely, in Transylvania,
instruction was likewise given in Latin. Nor can it be seriously
maintained that the Protestant teachers were more prone to let in the new
light than were the Catholic.




CHAPTER XI.


                                                               1711-1772.

In poetry proper, it is for the present period customary, but scarcely
necessary, to mention the Jesuit Francis Faludi (1704-1779), who has
put some wise saws and moral platitudes into light verse; and Baron
Ladislas Amadé (1703-1764), whose not unmelodious lyrics were sufficient
to give the successful courtier a mild reputation as an interesting
poet. In dramatic poetry there is nothing worth mentioning. The Jesuits
occasionally had their pupils play a patriotic or religious drama made
_ad hoc_, and good _pro tunc_. Of prose-writers there is one, and one
only, whose “Letters” written from Turkey, where he was in exile, have
abiding literary value. This was Clement Mikes (1690-1761), who was
brought up by Prince Rákóczy, to whom he proved constant under all
circumstances, and for this reason Mikes still belongs to the generation
of Hungarian nobles who cultivated their language with the pride of
true patriots. The “Letters” are not only full of historic interest,
especially with regard to the interior condition of the then still
mighty Turkish empire, but also as specimens of pure, idiomatic and
well-balanced Hungarian prose.

The remarkable works in History, Theology or Science of that period were,
as noticed, written in Latin. Of learned works written in Hungarian the
two best were by men who had spent their youth in the preceding century,
and were thus less afflicted with the gangrene of the decadence of the
period from 1711 to 1772; Michael Cserei (1668-1756), and Peter Apor
(1676-1752), both of very great nobility. Cserei wrote a “_Transylvanian
History_” (“_Erdélyi Historia_”), in which the events from 1661 to 1711
are told in a lively, naïve and pleasing style. Apor is the author of a
remarkable work on the history of the manners, customs, and institutions
of ancient Transylvania. It is entitled “_Metamorphosis Transylvaniae_,”
and its object is to show, by contrast, how low the country had sunk
from its former glory. His satire is not infrequently both scathing and
well-expressed.

The bent for erudite laboriousness gave rise to several works on the
history of Hungarian Literature. The still-life of the small town of
Bártfa in the county of Sáros must have hung heavily on the hands of
David Czwittinger, one of the lawyers of that town, who published, in
1711, a dry list of Hungarian writers, in alphabetical order. He was
distanced by the indefatigable and patriotic Peter Bod (1712-1769), who
had, like so many Protestants, spent several years at Dutch universities,
where he amassed much polyhistoric knowledge and a good library. There,
no doubt, he also acquired the taste for literary history, and in his
“Hungarian Athenæum” (“_Magyar Athénás_”, 1766) he collected much
material bearing on the lives and works of no less than six hundred
Hungarian authors. In Law or Philosophy there appeared, during this
period, no work in Hungarian claiming our attention.




CHAPTER XII.


                                                               1772-1825.

1772-1825. After a period of decadence, lasting for over sixty years,
Hungarian Literature was again brought to a state of revival and
progress, which has gone on almost uninterruptedly to the present day.
This revival is part of an immense revolution which swept over most
countries of continental Europe in the second half of the last century.
The most conspicuous and best known event of this Modern Renascence is
the series of terrific upheavals and wars commonly called the French
Revolution. It is, however, quite evident that the French Revolution
was only the politic aspect of a vast movement, which in many countries
outside France assumed the garb of intellectual revolutions. Thus the
mental achievements that, in their totality, are called the “classical
period” of German literature (1750-1805) are in the domain of Thought
and Sentiment, a revolution no less colossal and far-reaching than were
the ever-memorable proceedings of the French _assemblées_, or the bloody
epics of the Revolutionary campaigns. Both were gigantic onslaughts
against the _Ancien Régime_ in institutions, manners, thought and
sentiment. Accordingly, the course of both revolutions was—making due
allowance for externals—essentially the same. As the French Revolution
landed in, or rather was brought to its final consummation in the titanic
and all-embracing personality of Napoleon, so German literature met its
final trysting-place and culmination in the orchestral mind of Goethe.

The minor nations of Europe were seized by the same Revolution, if in a
manner considerably less intense. The very aggressiveness of the French
Revolution, its encroachments on the territories of Italy, Switzerland,
Germany and Austria, prevented those minor nations from enacting their
Revolution at once in its intellectual and political aspects. While
fighting the French, they were all engaged in following them on the lines
of the Revolution, first (1790-1830) for intellectual freedom; and then,
after the defeat of the French armies (1830-1848), for the very political
ideals that the French had been the first to proclaim. For, this was the
immense advantage of the French over the other nations on the continent:
they had brought their intellectual revolution through men like Turgot,
d’Alembert, Diderot, Voltaire, Rousseau, etc., to maturity, before they
started for their crusade of politic liberty; whereas the other nations
were a generation or two behind-hand, and still in the throes of their
intellectual renascence.

This is not the place for a laborious inquiry into the causes of that
immense Revolution which has, towards the end of the last, and in the
first five decades of the present century, completely altered the face of
European civilization. It is nevertheless necessary to give some account
of such causes as were instrumental in ripening the intellectual aspect
of that Revolution in Hungary. Among the leading causes was a structural
change in the population of Hungary on the one hand, and the reaction
against the provocative and anti-national measures of the Habsburgs on
the other.

Up to the sixties of the last century, the population of Hungary
consisted practically of (1) a rural population, comprising both
magnates, noblemen and peasants; and (2) a small urban population,
comprising largely foreign or Germanized craftsmen and tradespeople.
Under such circumstances, literature, which is pre-eminently an urban
growth, could not develop. For, not only was the urban population
too small and too much immersed in material pursuits, but the only
intellectual class, viz., the aristocracy, was living in the country,
that is, in an atmosphere unfavourable to continuous literary efforts. By
the end of the sixties, however, the structural change, above indicated,
took place. Owing to a series of measures issued by Maria Theresa and
Joseph II., the rural population of Hungary was liberated from its most
odious fetters. Bondage, and a sort of serfdom (_jobbágyság_), with all
its concomitant evils were almost abolished. Numerous rural families
left their obscure abodes, repaired to the towns, and urban life, for
the first time in Hungarian history, was raised above the low level on
which it had been vegetating for centuries. With the increase of urban
population came an increase of wealth and comfort; a greater activity
in commerce, both mercantile and social. Many a gifted Hungarian, who
would have previously spent his days in the obscurity of his county, now
willingly lived in one of the rising towns. With an accelerated speed
of work came a more rapid appreciation of talent, and a greater number
of authors. The influx of the rural population to the town facilitated
that mutual action and reaction between Nature and Man, which, in one
form or other, is the main spring of literature. In England, too, the
great period of Shakespeare was preceded by a similar structural change
in the population. The dissolution of the monasteries and the numerous
enclosures of commons, depriving as they did, hundreds of thousands of
rural people of their means of livelihood, drove them into the towns,
which rapidly ozonified that atmosphere of great intellectual stir,
without which no great writers are possible. In Germany, too, the period
of Lessing, Schiller, and Goethe was preceded by a new influx of the
rural population into the towns devastated by the thirty years’ war. Nor
can it be doubted that Italy, in possession of highly-organized and rich
towns long before any other mediæval nation, took, for this very reason,
the lead in all literary matters.

This broad fact of Hungarian history (totally neglected by the historians
of Hungary, probably because of its very broadness), must therefore be
considered as the prime mover in the revival of Hungarian Literature.
It created that mysterious propelling power which in times of progress
everybody feels and nobody can account for. It was the latent and
constant stimulus to renewed mental labour, and to keener delight in
it. Like great rivers it was swelled by smaller affluents of causes.
Thus that great structural change in nearly all parts of Hungary was
accompanied by two structural changes in limited layers of Hungarian
society. Maria Theresa, probably with a view of carrying Austrianization
into the very hearts of the Hungarian nobles had, in 1760, established
the famous Hungarian Guard in Vienna. Each county in Hungary was to send
up a few young noblemen to Vienna, where they were clad in sumptuous
style, and treated with all the seductive arts of a refined court. Thus
a considerable number of Hungarian noblemen were given an opportunity
for that higher education and refinement, which in former times had
been the privilege of the select few. Vienna was in many ways a centre
of Franco-German civilization, and the young Magyar noblemen derived,
from a lengthy stay in the Austrian capital, a benefit similar to that
for which English gentlemen flocked to Paris in the thirteenth and
seventeenth century. This then, constituted one of the minor changes in
the intellectual development of one class of Hungarians. There was also
another change. Joseph II., in dissolving over a third of the existing
monasteries, and a great number of monastic orders too, set free a
number of educated men, who would have otherwise led a sterile life in
the lonely cells of their monasteries. They now began to devote their
unexpected leisure to pursuits of a different kind; and some amongst them
became workers in the field of literature. Thus a new source of literary
production was opened up.

To these structural changes in the population of Hungary, that is, to the
home and internal cause of a potential revival, now came the external
agency of those anti-national measures against Hungarian institutions,
which Maria Theresa, with fine womanly tact, had used in a tentative
manner, but which were applied by Joseph II. in the most reckless and
irritating fashion. Joseph had one ideal: the homogeneous Austrian
state. Like all ideals it was unrealisable. It was worse than that:
it was suicidal. The Austrian empire has its very _raison d’être_ in
the heterogeneity of its constituent parts. To level down the Austrian
“lands” to one and the same pattern, is to deprive them of all vitality.
They live by contrast to one another. Unable to be quite independent each
by itself, they would, if unconnected by some common tie, only serve to
aggrandize either Prussia, Russia or Italy, and so upset the balance
of Europe in a fatal manner. United by the dynastic tie, they form an
imposing, if incongruous whole, the component parts still retaining very
much of a strong individuality. Any attempt at forcing them into blank
uniformity must needs be answered by a still stronger attempt on their
part to rend the dynastic tie asunder. The various provinces have, since
1648, and with respect to Hungary, since 1711, made no civil war on one
another. Not one of them had, as had Prussia in Germany since Frederick
II.’s time, or England since Cromwell’s time, the supremacy over the
rest. Their sole union and bond was in their common dynasty. To try to
reduce them to one and the same level, as Joseph II. did, was both the
worst dynastic and national policy imaginable. The Austrian provinces,
then or now, if reduced to complete uniformity, will first of all
abolish the dynasty—as superfluous. In the _egalitarian_ ordinances of
Joseph II. there was so much that was subversive of the very pillars and
coping-stones of the whole Austrian edifice, that the Hungarians, as well
as all the other nationalities under his rule (Belgians, Czechs, Poles,
etc.), forthwith rose in a body in defence of their privileges, charters,
rights; in fact, of their existence severally and collectively. The
Emperor wanted to abolish the Hungarian language, Hungarian institutions,
Hungarian society. At once the Hungarians, who had then almost entirely
neglected their language, learned to regard it as the chief palladium
of their nationality. Hungarian periodicals were started; such as the
“_Magyar Múzsa_” (since 1787); “_Magyar Múzeum_” (since 1788, in Kassa);
“_Mindenes Gyűjtemény_” (since 1789); “_Orpheus_” (since 1790, edited
by Kazinczy); “_Urania_” (since 1794, edited by Kármán), etc. Hungarian
actors were encouraged; Hungarian literary societies were started, the
oldest being that founded by John Kis, at Sopron, in 1790. These efforts
were immeasurably increased in efficiency by the publication of very
numerous Magyar works in nearly all _genres_ of literature, and in styles
and “schools” of great divergency. The members of the Guard naturally
proceeded on French lines, taking the great French writers, and chiefly
Voltaire, as their model. The foremost members of the new urban element,
which also included many an unfrocked monk, coming as they did from the
country where the Magyar language and folk-poetry had never died out, and
where the national pulse beat strongest, proceeded on national lines.
The older country-gentry, and numerous released monks, conversant above
all with Latin literature, proclaimed the classical metres and forms as
the only safeguard and aim of literature; while another section of the
new urban element followed in the wake of the Germans, whose classical
writers were just then at the height of their fame. This great divergence
of schools was in itself proof of the definite revival of Hungarian
Literature. In the spiritual republic, no less than in the political,
parties are of the very essence of vigorous life. By the end of the
last century there could have no longer been any doubt about the strong
vitality of Hungarian Literature.




CHAPTER XIII.


                                                               1772-1825.

The first of these “schools” to publish serious works with the intention
of reforming the literature of Hungary, were the members of the Hungarian
Guard at Vienna, and chiefly George Bessenyei (1747-1811).[2] In 1772 he
published a tragedy, entitled “Agis” (“_Agis tragédiája_”) in which he
attempted to give, within the strict rules of the Franco-Aristotelean
tri-unity of time, place and action, a model for his contemporaries. In
point of language, _Agis_ is not without some merits; as a dramatic work
it has long been regarded as a failure. Bessenyei was more successful in
his comedies (“Philosophus,” etc.), in which he even contrived to create
a type, _Pontyi_, representing the narrow-minded, ultra-conservative
country-squire of his time. His style is held to be much better
still in his prose works containing philosophical essays after the
rationalistic fashion of his epoch. Amongst the numerous colleagues
and literary followers of Bessenyei were: Abraham Barcsai (1742-1806),
Alexander Báróczi (1735-1809), who excelled chiefly in translations
from the French; Ladislas Baranyi, Joseph Naláczi, Bessenyei’s own
brother, Alexander, who tried his hand at Milton’s “_Paradise Lost_,”
etc. To the Bessenyei circle (“_Bessenyei György társasága_”) belonged
also Paul Ányos (1756-1784), in whose mournful and sentimental poems
there are many traces of genuine poetry. Nor must Joseph Péczeli be
forgotten (1750-1792), who through his numerous translations from French
and English works (Edward Young’s “Night Thoughts”) and his “Fables”
(“_Mesék_”) deserved highly of Hungarian Literature.

The next in time and merit was the school of the Classicists, or more
properly speaking, Latinists. The first four remarkable members of that
school were all unfrocked priests. Baróti David Szabó (1739-1819), and
Joseph Rajnis (Reinisch) were ex-Jesuits; Nicolas Révai (1750-1807)
was a Piarist, and Benedictus Virág (1752(?)-1830) an ex-Paulist. The
circumstances of their mental development above indicated led them
naturally to an imitation of the Latin poets; and Virág in Hungary,
like Ramler in Germany, or Cowley in England, was held to be one of
the numerous “Horaces,” in whom the nascent literatures of Europe
were happily so rich. In ripe mellowness of formal beauty and musical
ring Virág cannot, we are afraid, be said to have seriously challenged
the laurels of the friend of Augustus. His _Works_ (_Poétai Munkák_,
1799) are, on the other hand, inspired by a noble glow of patriotism,
which might have added some lustre to the poems even of Flaccus. Virág
translated Horace into Hungarian, as Baróti had done with the _Aeneid_.
The poetical works of the other two ex-priests were of an inferior kind.

To the above two schools now was added the third; the national or
genuinely Magyar school. The two former laid special stress on purity and
perfection of form, both external and internal. In fact, the classicists
came near sacrificing everything else to correctness of form. In this
they were partly justified, partly supported by the peculiar adaptability
of the Hungarian language to the most complicated of classic metres.
Hexameters or alcaics are just as natural to Hungarian, as they are to
Greek and Latin; and infinitely more so than to any other Indo-German
language of Europe. The classicists, and especially the greatest of them,
Berzsenyi—see below—were able to handle the most national and intimate
subjects in the most foreign of verse-forms, and with perfect ease too.
This seemed to go far in convincing many writers, that classical forms
were the only ones to adopt, and classical models the only ones to
follow. The prosodic wealth of the Hungarian language is, however, not
exhausted by its classic metres by far. From time immemorial Hungarian
poetry was wedded to Hungarian music, and the latter, with its pointed
rhythms and sudden irruptions of cadences, was quite unfitted for the
stately calm of antique metres. In German classical music, classical
metres, such as the hexameter or the alcaic may be, and have been
employed. In Hungarian music they are out of place altogether. Here,
then, was the inner justification of the “Magyar” school. Its members
strongly and rightly felt, that in the cult of antique prosody the
classicists had overstepped the bounds; that Hungarian poetry needed
forms and moulds other than those of Virgil or Horace; and that the short
cross-rhymed stanza was to Hungarian Literature, what the violin and the
“_czimbalom_” (dulcimer) were to Hungarian music. It is impossible to
play Hungarian music on the organ.

Of the Magyar school was Ádám Horváth (1760-1820), who in addition
to an epic called “_Hunnias_” (1787), in which he tried to sing the
exploits of John Hunyadi after the battle of Varna (1444), published a
number of simple poems in the style of the folk-poetry of the Hungarian
peasants. By refining the prosody of that _genre_ he introduced it
into the literary world. The most successful of the Magyarists was
Count Joseph Gvadányi (1725-1801), whose “A Village Notary’s Travel to
Buda” (“_Egy falusi nótárius budai utazása_,” 1790), was a felicitous
attempt to expose, in the form of a novel in verse, the utter decadence
and denationalization of the town-people and the gentry of the middle
of the last century. The “notary” has survived as a type. Gvadányi’s
other novels are on the same lines, all of them being animated by a
resolute patriotism. He was followed by Andreas Dugonics (1740-1818),
an ex-Piarist, whose “_Etelka_” a novel (1788) became very popular,
chiefly owing to its strongly accentuated patriotism and anti-Austrian
feeling, and also to the racy, popular language he used. He also compiled
a valuable collection of Hungarian proverbs and apophthegms (“_Magyar
példabeszédek és jeles mondások_”). The number of writers belonging to
the Magyar school in the two last decades of the eighteenth century
is considerable. They all excel in patriotic verve, and much of the
anonymous work done at that time for the restoration of Hungarian
Literature is due to them. We cannot here give more than a list of a
few names. John Kónyi, Stephán Gáti, Francis Nagy, the first Hungarian
translator of the Iliad, and Joachim Szekér, who did much for the
bettering of female education in Hungary. Separate mention must be made
of a number of Magyarist poet-naturalists whose centre was the city
of Debreczen, and amongst whom were John Földi (1755-1801), who wrote
some remarkable works on Hungarian prosody in its relation to music;
and Michael Fazekas, whose “_Ludas Matyi_,” a chap-book written in the
interests of the peasants, has long been one of the most popular comic
stories. Nor were the usual excrescences of the juvenile epoch of a
new language wanting. A limited class of now obscure writers (Gregory
Édes, John Varjas, etc.), abused the great flexibility of the Hungarian
language in verse-forms and metres of the most absurd kind. They were the
caricaturists of the rapidly growing Magyar idiom.




CHAPTER XIV.


                                                               1772-1825.

The formation of different schools of literature was of great benefit
to the growth and advance of Hungarian poetry and prose. Many a
minor talent could and did, by clinging to and being supported by a
“school,” steady his work. After the lapse of some time, however, the
exclusiveness of “schools” would have done great harm to the higher
development of Hungarian Literature. By 1795 more than schools and
literary guilds was needed. The nation wanted powerful individualities
who were, so to speak, schools themselves. Fortunately for the cause
of the Hungarian intellect, such men did arise in time. The first of
them was Francis Verseghy (1757-1822). An ex-Piarist, and involved in
the conspiracy of Martinovics: he had gone through the experiences of
a priest, a politician and a state-prisoner. His poetical works, which
are very numerous, manifest a tender, yet strong mind, much ease of
form, and a power of satire. He translated the _Marseillaise_ into
Hungarian. He is at his best in short poems. What raises him above most
of his predecessors is his considerable independence as a poet. He
clings slavishly to no school, and succeeds in combining some of the
excellencies of all. In genius he was far excelled by tempestuous John
Bacsányi (1763-1845), who espoused the cause of the French Revolution,
did some work for Napoleon, and was in 1814 taken back to Austria, where
he died an exile. He brought Ossian’s poems to Hungary; and in his fierce
poems all the fire of the revolutionary fever may be felt. Yet with all
that he could reduce to fine proportions and to efficiency neither his
life nor his work. In the melancholy and sweet poems of the ex-priest,
Gabriel Dayka (1768-1796), the Hungarian Hölty, which have to the present
day lost nothing of their Wordsworth-like delicacy, we have the first
instalment of those mournful _largos_, in which Hungarian Literature is
as rich as is Hungarian music.

These three writers were as the forerunners of literary individualities
of a much higher type. The first of them was Joseph Kármán (1769-1795).
He too spent some time in Vienna, where then centred the political and
social life of a large portion of Europe. Like so many more Hungarians,
he burst into enthusiasm for his country by staying and living amongst
a foreign people who, in the nobler traits of character, were decidedly
inferior to the Magyars, and who yet were considered to be their rulers.
The people of Austria, and especially the Viennese, are utterly different
from the Hungarians. Their love of the burlesque, of the grotesquely
funny, of the clownish, stood out then, as it still largely does, in
sharp contrast to the dignified gravity of the Magyars. To be considered
as subject to people so very much less adapted for the functions of
government than themselves, was at all times galling to the Hungarians;
and perhaps never more so, than in the nineties of the last century, when
a mighty wave of opposition to the Habsburgs was sweeping over Hungary.
Kármán’s was a most sensitive soul. He fully realized that to render
Hungarian Literature more perfect and independent was first of all a
great political deed. He keenly felt, that Hungary, unless emancipated
intellectually, must fall a victim to the then immense ascendancy of
Austria. Every good poem, every good novel, written by a Hungarian in
the language of his country, was then of more service to Hungary than
all the proceedings at the national assemblies. Kármán, despite his
extreme youth, at once set to work. He proclaimed that Pesth ought to be
the literary centre of Hungary. He started a quarterly (“_Urania_”),
and hastened to write his “_Memoirs of Fanny_” (“_Fanni hagyományai_”).
The latter is a novel in the form of letters and leaves from a diary.
Fanny, the heroine, loves with all the inconsiderate passion of a
young girl, a young man, whom she is not allowed to marry. She dies of
a broken heart in the arms of her lover. The plot of the novel is of
the simplest. The excessive sentimentality of the heroine, who is, as
it were, drowned in the floods of her own feelings, is to our present
taste somewhat overdone. With all these shortcomings, however, Kármán
has poured over his little story so much of the golden light of fine,
unaffected style, and has enriched it with so many touches of the most
effective descriptions of scenery, that “_Fanny_” will always rank among
the foremost of the literary products of the kind, of which Goethe’s
“_Werther_” is the most famous.

The second great poet was Michael Vitéz Csokonai (1773-1805). Born at
Debreczen, a town whose famous fairs brought together annually an immense
concourse of the agricultural and trading people of Hungary, Csokonai was
at an early age imbued with the riches of the gallery of types for which
his country has always been so remarkable. Although at all periods of
his irregular and vagrant life Csokonai kept in close touch with books,
Bürger amongst the Germans, Pope amongst the English, and Metastasio
amongst the Italians, being his favourites; yet the real source of his
surprising fertility of invention, and surety of draughtsmanship was laid
in his constant contact with the people itself. His proud and independent
character, the ruggedness of which was not rendered less objectionable
by an independent fortune, drove him from post to post. As a roving poet
he visited most of the counties, making friends everywhere, protectors
and helpers nowhere; and when he finally returned to his old mother’s
house, his health was irretrievably shattered by poverty, privations and
occasional excesses. He is a great poet. His language is full of savour
and truly Magyar. He has abundant and merciful humour, without lacking
wit. Frequently he soars to philosophical heights of thought, where, like
the eagle, he broods alone. In his lyrical poetry there is much of the
rhapsodic frenzy, which was to make Hungary’s greatest poet, Petőfi, as
unique in poetry, as Liszt is in music. Csokonai’s most famous poem is
a comic epic, somewhat in the style of the _Rape of the Lock_, called
“_Dorottya_,” or the _Triumph of the Ladies at the Carnival_ (“_A dámák
diadalma a farsangon_”), in four parts. It narrates the warfare of the
ladies of a small town, under the leadership of an old maid (Dorottya),
with the men of the same place. The women complain of the shortness of
the carnival, of the rarity of weddings, etc., and attempt to steal the
registers of births compromising to many of them. In the end, the women
fall out amongst themselves, Venus steps in, rejuvenating Dorottya, and
making peace by marrying the contending parties to each other. The tone
of that comic epic is throughout one of genuine mirth, and the language
forms a fit drapery of the fleeting scenes of this charming carnival.
The types stand out with great plasticity, and in this respect at least,
Csokonai’s _Dorottya_ need fear no comparison with Pope’s masterpiece.
The critics of his time did not recognize Csokonai’s greatness; and his
townsmen, nearly all of them rigid Calvinists, did not think much of a
poet in whose stanzas wine flowed abundantly, and love was rampant in
forms at times unrestrained. When, therefore, some years after the poet’s
death, admirers of his wanted to have his statue erected at Debreczen,
and the words, “I too lived in Arcadia” engraved upon it, the good
burghers of Debreczen violently opposed the suggestion. For, as if trying
to give the departed poet exquisite material for another comic epic, they
alleged, that by “Arcadia,” was meant, as they had learned, a country
with good pasture, especially for donkeys; and since they solemnly
protested against being considered donkeys, etc., etc. From this incident
followed the so-called Arcadian lawsuit (“_arkádiai pör_”).




CHAPTER XV.


                                                               1772-1825.

In the literature of all civilized nations we meet with certain writers,
whose great effect on their contemporaries was owing less to the absolute
excellency of single works of theirs, than to the general tone and power
of suggestion inherent in all their individuality. Such are, in England,
Dr. Johnson and Thomas Carlyle; in France, Diderot and Renan; in Germany,
Hamann and Herder. Without being creative geniuses, they influence their
time as if they were such. One does so by the brilliancy of his talk,
like Johnson; the other by pamphlets or essays _de omni re scibili_,
like Herder; a third by boldly attempting to rear a new intellectual
world in the place of the fabric of old literature and knowledge, like
Diderot. The merit of such men is immense, yet relative. They deserve
more highly of literary men, than of literature. They spread interest in
or taste for good literature. They are critical, not constructive; and
so decidedly preparatory and temporary is their work, that in the whole
range of the world’s literature there has so far been one man, and one
alone, whose genius shone equally in this preparatory or critical work,
and in the still more precious work of positive creativeness too. That
man was Lessing. In him the critical faculty did not seriously impair the
creative; and he rendered immense services to German literature both by
what he destroyed, by what he suggested and by what he created.

Hungarian Literature was fortunate enough to find one of those initiators
and suggestive stimulators during the period of its great revival, in
the person of Francis Kazinczy (1759-1831). His work has frequently
been compared to that of Lessing. No greater injustice could be done
to Kazinczy. To compare him to the author of “_Laokoon_,” “_Emilia
Galotti_,” and “_Anti-Goetze_,” is to render him much smaller than he
really was. Without being a Lessing by far, he had a very considerable
and beneficial influence on Hungarian writers, many of them greater
than he. He was the son of a well-to-do gentleman of the county of
Bihar, which has a population of both Magyars and Roumanians, and does
not therefore belong to the counties where the purely Magyar spirit is
permeating all the phases of life. To this circumstance, no less than
to his education, must be ascribed Kazinczy’s little sympathy with the
strongly Magyar and nationalist aspirations of the Debreczen school.
His youth he spent chiefly in North Hungary, where the study of German
literature was then rife in the better circles of society. Having
acquired a competent knowledge of German, French and English, he poured
forth, since 1791, numerous, most carefully composed translations from
Shakespeare (_Hamlet_), Goethe, Molière, Klopstock, Herder, Lessing,
etc. From 1794 to 1801 he was kept in various state prisons, for having
been, as was alleged, implicated in the conspiracy of Martinovics.
This terrible experience left no particular traces either on his mind
or on his character. Subsequently, as previously, nay during his
imprisonment, he was busy with the elaboration of essays, critical,
historical, or novelistic, all of which had two distinct aims: first—to
reform the Hungarian literary language, by the introduction of new words
and especially new idioms; secondly, to reform Hungarian Literature
by modelling it after the standard of Greek masterpieces. Both lines
of reform were in the right direction. The Hungarian language was in
Kazinczy’s youth still far from developed. Its vocabulary was limited
mostly to the designation of things material, and quite fallow for the
production of terms expressing things abstract or æsthetic. It resembled
a country in which there is abundant currency in the shape of small
coin; it lacked gold coins and bank-notes of great value. Yet like
Hungary itself, its language was replete with gold-mines. In the rich and
racy vocabulary of the common people there was both overt material and
abundant hints for material hidden under the surface. Kazinczy, instead
of taking these hints—instead of coining his new terms and idioms from
the language of the common people, as he ought to have done, preferred
to coin them according to standards taken from the western languages of
Europe. In this he was grievously mistaken. There are unfortunately very
few, if any, true dialects of the Hungarian language. This, the greatest
drawback to Magyar writers, as the reverse of this deficiency is the
greatest advantage to the writers of Germany, France, Italy or England,
was rendered very much more harmful by Kazinczy, in that he totally
neglected the few dialectic features together with the common household
language of the people. In his efforts to enrich the language he thus
could not but obtain results of an inferior type. His syntactic moves
have not been followed on the whole; and of his new words few have gained
general recognition.

He was much more successful in the second of his life-long efforts; in
the introduction of the æsthetic ideals of the Greeks into Hungary. We
have seen above, that the neglect of the study of Greek literature in
Hungary had, in the preceding periods stunted the growth of Hungarian
Literature. Literature, like sculpture, is born of Greek parents; and
none but nations trained in the Hellenic world of ideas, can make a
literature proper. In Germany, Lessing, Wieland, Herder and Goethe
were so profoundly imbued with Hellenic modes of thought and moulds of
expression, that many of their best works have, as has been felicitously
remarked, enriched ancient Greek literature. So deep were in Germany,
through the works of these men, the furrows of Greek thought, that even
writers like Schiller, who did not know Greek, were full of the Greek
spirit of beauty and moderation, and amongst its most ardent propagators.
It was from these German Hellenes that Kazinczy learned the great and
invaluable lesson of Greek idealism, that spiritual atmosphere in which
the human intellect feels as different from its ordinary sensations, as
does the human body in a river. Kazinczy was the first of the Hungarian
writers whose soul had undergone the process of Platonization, to use
this clumsy but expressive word for a process, the chief stages of which
are an increased familiarity with mental tempers, the greatest exponent
of which was Plato. In Kazinczy’s wide correspondence with nearly all
the literary men of his age; in his greater and smaller works; in his
personal interviews with the leading men of his time; he invariably, and
with noble persistency, endeavoured to instil Hellenic ideals of form,
of beauty, of serenity. He had clearly seen how much German literature
had been benefited by the adoption of those ideals; he sincerely and
fervently wanted to confer the same boon on the literature of his own
country. This endeavour constitutes his greatness, as its success does
his historic importance. His own poems are mediocre; yet he has the
merit of being the author of the first sonnets in Hungarian; his forte
lies in his prose works, and there chiefly in his translations from the
classical writers of Rome, Germany, France and England. It was also
his indefatigable activity which gave rise to a wholesome literary
controversy about the nature and limits of a radical reform of the
Hungarian language as a vehicle of literature. This controversy merits
special mention.

Omitting the names of some learned precursors, whose works have not much
advanced the philological study of the Hungarian language, it may be
stated, that the first to subject that idiom to a careful and systematic
study based on researches into its historical development, was Nicolas
Révai. In his _Elaboratior Grammatica Hungarica_ (1806, 2 vols.), he
summed up his previous essays, and placed Hungarian philology on a
tolerably sure basis, after the manner subsequently adopted by Jacob
Grimm for Germanic philology. Although he still hankered after the
purely imaginary affinity between Magyar and the Semitic languages, he
yet succeeded in clearing up many a vital point in Hungarian historic
grammar. With regard to the then wanted reform of the language, he taught
that that reform ought to proceed on the lines of the laws of language
as discovered by a close study of the ancient remains of Hungarian
Literature. He was vehemently opposed by Verseghy (see page 85), who
taught that the reform ought to be guided, not by the bygone forms of
Hungarian, but by those actually in force. It is now pretty clear, that
while the science of language is sure to be enriched by methods of study
such as that of Révai, the art of language is more likely to gain by the
advice of Verseghy. Kazinczy, who possessed neither Révai’s philologic
erudition, nor Verseghy’s powers of philologic analysis, but who adopted
principles of reform from both, Kazinczy became the centre of the
passionate warfare that now arose for the golden fleece of “Pure Magyar.”
The Conservative party, whose headquarters were at Debreczen, Somogy,
Szeged, and Veszprém, were called orthologues; the adherents of Kazinczy,
neologues. Satyric writings were published by both; by the orthologues:
“_Búsongó Amor_,” 1806, and the still more famous “_Mondolat_,” 1813; by
the neologues: “_Felelet_,” 1816, written by Kölcsey and Szemere; and
chiefly, the prize-essay of Count Joseph Teleki, in 1817. In the end most
of the work of the neologues has been accepted by the nation.




CHAPTER XVI.


                                                               1772-1825.

The great campaigns fought by Austria against the French Revolution and
Napoleon were in reality the prelude of the subsequent warfare of the
Conservative and reactionary classes against the rising Liberalism of
modern times. In literature, that mighty duel of night and light was
reiterated by the struggle between the romantic and the national schools
of poetry. The romantic writers, whether Byron in England, Chateaubriand
in France, or Eichendorff in Germany, were all perfect in form, and
morbid in subject. They were to poetry what Prince Metternich was to
politics, a genius of twilight. So natural was this connection between
the French Revolution on the one hand, and national, or sound literature
on the other, that they who personally fought in the wars against the
Convention and the Directory (1792-1799), as later on against Napoleon
(1799-1815), invariably inclined to the romantic or the reactionary
school. This will explain the rise of romantic works in Hungary at a
time when their classical and national school had scarcely begun to
appear. The first great romantic Hungarian poet is Alexander Kisfaludy
(1772-1844). He had fought in the Austrian army in Italy and Germany
against the revolutionary armies of France, and so naturally considered
the gentry of his country as the true representatives of his nation. In
1801 he published the first part of a series of lyrical poems called
“_Himfy Szerelmei_,” through which runs the uniting link of luckless love
for one and the same maiden. Kisfaludy lived for some time in the country
of Petrarch, and the influence of the great singer of hopeless love is
clearly visible in the Magyar poet’s work. It is written in stanzas of
twelve lines, and is full of that shapeless but sweet sentimentality
which so characterizes the romantic writers. It is like a landscape in
which the most attractive part is the fleeting clouds: mountains, rivers,
houses, and persons being all blurred and vague. It is atmospheric
poetry, full of sweet words and sounds, as if coming from distant music.
In 1807 Kisfaludy published another part of his _Himfy_, this time
singing the joys of requited love, as the first did its sorrows. The
work was received with great enthusiasm, more especially, of course, by
the unmarried population of the country; and Kisfaludy was encouraged to
write novels, dramas and ballads in great number. All these works are
meant to form an apotheosis of mediæval times in Hungary; just as the
German and French romantic writers revelled in the charms of chateaux
and knights and crusades. Some of his ballads are really good, such as
_Csobáncz_. His dramas are worthless.




CHAPTER XVII.


                                                               1772-1825.

The romanticism started by Kisfaludy did not, however, retard the other
literary movements in Hungary. The Hungarian language is in many ways
too closely akin to the classic languages, if not in body, at least
in prosody, to have easily forsaken the classic forms which had long
been used by writers of this period, for the sake of romanticism. The
Hungarian language is in that respect like Hungarian music. Although
apparently nothing can be more remote from the strict moderation and
stately respectability of classical music than Hungarian music, yet the
strictest of the forms of classical music, viz., the fugue, has a curious
internal resemblance to Magyar airs, in that the latter easily yield
magnificent fugue themes, and preludes to fugues. Likewise the Hungarian
language lends itself with surprising felicitousness to the expression of
the highest form of classic metrical poetry: the ode.

Daniel Berzsenyi (1776-1826) was the poet who fully realized the
riches of the classical veins in the mines of the Hungarian language,
and who gave his country a number of perfect odes written in the metre
and in the spirit of the best of antique odes. His patriotic odes, most
famous of which is the one beginning “Perishing is now the once strong
Magyar” (“_Romlásnak indult hajdan erős Magyar_” in alcaic metre); his
religious odes, most perfect of which is “God-seeking” (“_Fohászkodás_”
in alcaic metre); show the chief quality of classical poetry: perfect
form wedded to hale and true subjects. He moves on the Alpine roads and
in the ravines of the antique arduous metres with natural ease; for the
real subjects of his poetry are akin and similar to Alpine sunsets and
sunrises, majestic glaciers, and despondent abysses. He is sublime and
natural; and amongst modern writers of odes in antique metres only the
German Platen, when at his best, can compare with him. His poems were
listened to with rapturous attention by the old warriors and politicians
of the National Assembly, and read with equal enthusiasm and admiration
by the youth of Hungary. From the height whereon he places himself with
his lyre, there is no difference of size or age in his listeners. Nor
has time abated one tittle of the glory of his best poems. Some of the
best critics of his epoch (amongst them Kölcsey) did not appreciate him
adequately. At present we cannot sufficiently wonder at their blindness.
We must console ourselves with the thought that poets, like the sun,
are, as a rule, not noticed for some time after their appearance on the
horizon. In the time of Berzsenyi there died at Vienna (in 1820) a young
Hungarian, probably by his own hand, in utter distress; his name was
Ladislas Tóth de Ungvárnémet. His mind, living in the regions of the
Greek ideals (he even wrote Greek poetry), could not endure the sordid
materialism of his surroundings. He left, in Hungarian, a tragedy after
the Hellenic model, “_Narcisz_.” Hungary has, by the premature death of
Tóth, probably lost her chance of having her Shelley.




CHAPTER XVIII.


                                                               1772-1825.

The enlightened foreigner from France, England or Germany, reading about
the allegedly great literary works written by Hungarians, Poles, Czechs
or other nationalities who have so far not succeeded in playing first
fiddle in the European concert, will probably indulge in a polite doubt
as to the exceeding excellence of those works, not one of which has ever
been spoken of in the columns of the leading papers or periodicals of
London, Paris, Berlin, Rome or Vienna. In the preceding pages we have
ventured to mention Pope and Shelley, and a few great German poets in
the same breath with great Magyar writers. This may appear preposterous
to Englishmen or Germans. Far from reviling them for that, we would
rather hasten to add, that in a certain sense they are quite right.
Pope’s genius is in one most essential point decidedly superior to that
of Csokonai (see page 88). Pope’s best poems are not exclusively English
in taste, subject-matter or form. They belong to that class of European
literature, the best products of which may be relished with equal
delight by Spaniards and Danes alike. They are European in character;
and so much is this the case with the foremost of those writers, that
Shakespeare, for instance, is far better known, by the youth at least
of Germany, Austria and Hungary, than by that of England. In the great
German writers there is little of that specifically German tone, which
people other than Germans cannot very well enjoy. In Lessing there is no
trace of the sentimentality and liquoriciousness of his native province;
in Schiller there is not a trace of Suabian cunning or lumbersomeness;
and Goethe might just as well have been born at Syracuse under Gelon,
or at Athens under Pericles. Is there any trace of Puritanism, this the
most specifically English feature of his time, in Shakespeare? The major
part of the better writers of Hungary or Poland, on the other hand, have
suffered their intense patriotism to make such inroads on the literary
character of their works, that the latter frequently lose all their point
to readers outside Hungary and Poland.

These reflections are suggested by a consideration of the works of
Francis Kölcsey (1790-1838), a really great orator and a good poet. Born
in the county of Bihar, where he spent the best part of his short life,
he employed his magnificent powers of oratory chiefly in inculcating
in the Hungarians of his time the lesson of patriotism. There can be
no doubt that his speeches, his lofty “_Paraenesis_,” and some of his
critical work are written in that gorgeously laborious style which has
made the fame of Bossuet in France and Gibbon in England. His poems
breathe a mild melancholy that gives them a sombre tint of peculiar
beauty. Yet, on the whole, he never oversteps the narrow limits of Magyar
life as then existent; and what appeals to men of all countries and all
nations found but a feeble rhetorical echo in his writings. No young
Hungarian can read his works without deep emotion. In maturer years,
however, he finds that Kölcsey’s works belong to those that one gladly
remembers to have read once, without desiring to read them again.

The growth of Hungarian Literature from 1772 to 1825 was, compared to
that of England from 1570 to 1620; of Germany from 1760 to 1805; or of
France from 1630 to 1675, a slow one. Many of the Hungarian writers of
that period were endowed with gifts of no common calibre; and some of
them, such as Kazinczy, Kisfaludy, Csokonai, Berzsenyi, Kölcsey, can
certainly not be denied the distinction of genius. Yet with all their
efforts, individual or collective, they did not quicken the step of
literary progress very considerably. This was owing to the fact, that
Hungary had as yet no literary centres, such as England possessed in
London; France in Paris; and Germany in Berlin, Leipsic or Weimar. Nearly
all the poets and other writers so far mentioned lived in small towns
scattered over the country, and, from the lack of good communications,
were practically isolated from one another. Kazinczy lived in the county
of Zemplén; Kölcsey in the county of Bihar; Kisfaludy, Berzsenyi, Ádám
Horváth in the cis-Danubian counties. There were, it is true, some
literary centres in Pesth; such as the house of the able folk-poet
Vitkovics. But they were few, and Pesth was, as yet, not a great capital.
Literature needs local concentration of high-strung people. Country life
gives the aptitude for poetic work; intense urban life alone ripens that
aptitude into creative talent. Virgil at Mantua, or Cicero at Arpinum
would have remained sterile provincials. The great mental agitation set
in motion by the writers in Magyar above mentioned was given additional
fuel by a very large number of Hungarians writing in Latin and French.
The ideas of the French and German Rationalism (“_Aufklaerung_”) of that
time were eagerly seized upon, elaborated and discussed in over five
hundred works and pamphlets treating of Religion, Politics, Law and
Philosophy. Hungary was thus during that period (1772-1825), instinct
with great intellectual powers; and all that was wanting was to focus
them. As long as the political or _the_ life of Hungary was crippled by
the autocracy of Metternich, that is, down to 1825-1830, that national
focus could not be forthcoming. With the revival of the political
life in and through the national Diet assembled at Pesth in 1825, the
only remaining condition of a quicker and more energetic pulsation of
Hungary’s literary life was fulfilled. Henceforth Hungary employed the
right strategy for the able men of her literary army, and the result
was a short but brilliant period of literary productions, many of
which attain to the higher and some to the highest degrees of artistic
perfection. And inasmuch as the creation of the national focus was the
most potent cause of the unprecedented revival of Hungary’s literature,
we must first treat of that glorious man who was chiefly instrumental in
its realization: Count Stephen Széchenyi.




CHAPTER XIX.


                                                               1825-1850.

1825-1850. Count Stephen Széchenyi, “_the greatest Magyar_” as Kossúth
called him, was one of those rare patriots whose enthusiasm is tempered
by the most careful respect for facts and practical probabilities, while
their love of detail and material work is broadened and elevated by the
noble passion of disinterested patriotism. The maxim of his life was,
“Hungary has not yet been; she will be” (“_Magyarország nem volt hanem
lesz_”). A scion of a magnate family he had, like Mirabeau, derived much
light from the study of foreign countries. As most of his contemporaries,
he was convinced that Hungary, unless aroused from her political and
industrial torpor, could not in her then state claim a place amongst
the civilized nations of Europe. He was by no means of a revolutionary
disposition against the Habsburgs. On the contrary, he wanted to realize
all the vast reforms he contemplated in peace with Austria; for being a
sort of enthusiastic Walpole (—the manes of Sir Robert will pardon us
that epithet!—) his activity was directed mainly, at times at least, to
the bettering of the material condition of Hungary.

Széchenyi did not, however, neglect the intellectual needs of his
country either. When still a young cavalry officer he offered one year’s
revenue of his estates (£10,000 in value; nominally, £5,000) for the
establishment of a national Hungarian Academy of Science, the members of
which were to consider the cultivation and development of the Hungarian
language as their prime duty. Széchenyi’s magnanimous offer was at once
responded to by similar offers on the part of three rich magnates (Count
George Andrássy, Count George Károlyi, and Baron Abraham Vay), and thus a
serious commencement was made with the founding of an intellectual centre
in Hungary. The Academy (“_Magyar Tudományos Akadémia_”) was formally
established in 1830, its first president being Count Joseph Teleki.
Among the great number of linguistic, historic, and scientific works,
both original and translations, published by the Academy, we may mention
the “_Monumenta_,” or historic sources of Hungary; several smaller
dictionaries for current use, and the great Dictionary of the Hungarian
Language, edited by Gregory Czuczor and John Fogarasi (1844-1874); the
translation of the best works of foreign authors on History, Philosophy,
Law, and Science, including, amongst others, almost all the standard
works of English literature; and a series of original researches into all
branches of Science, descriptive, mathematical, physical and chemical.
Together with numerous writers of that period, Széchenyi also attempted,
and very felicitously too, an internal reform of the Magyar language, to
the vocabulary of which he added some needed and now generally accepted
terms.

Széchenyi’s restless propaganda succeeded in moving even the
ultra-conservative and indolent country-gentry; and in the thirties many
a nobleman had a residence of his own built in Pesth. The Country began
to move into the Town. In 1837, the national Hungarian theatre was opened
at Pesth. Numerous newspapers and periodicals were published; the number
of press-organs in Magyar, which was five in 1820, rising to ten in 1830,
and to twenty-six in 1840. In 1891 there were 645 Magyar newspapers and
periodicals in Hungary. The work meted out to the “Academy” being rather
of a technical nature, the “Kisfaludy-Society” (“_Kisfaludy-Társaság_”)
was formed in 1836, with the view of promoting the interests of
_belles-lettres_ proper in Hungary. Thanks to the patriotic and
well-directed activity of that Society, many an unknown but gifted author
was enabled to bring his work under the notice of the country. Its
prizes were, and are eagerly competed for, and it has done very much
for the great progress of good literature in Hungary. Historical and
archæological societies were formed in many parts of the country; and the
nation became conscious of the greatness of Hungarian music, which in the
wizard hands of Francis Liszt (1811-1887), the greatest of all executive,
and one of the most striking of creative musicians, was fast becoming
the admiration of Europe. Nor were the schools neglected. Since 1844 the
language of instruction in schools was mostly Hungarian. The political
reverses of the Hungarians in 1849 caused the introduction of the German
language into the schools of Hungary; in 1861, however, the national
language was again reinstated in its rights, and now the language of
instruction in all the schools and colleges of Hungary is Magyar.

These are some of the most important intellectual reforms which, from
1825 to 1848 completely changed the face of the Hungary of olden times.
While previous to 1825, all attempts at reform were restricted to small
circles and straggling individuals, and could, therefore, bear no fruit
for the nation at large, now the efforts for the renascence of the
material and intellectual life of the country were concentrated by the
creation of a true capital of social, literary and scientific centres;
by the co-operation of great numbers of patriotic and able men; and by
the powerful, nay, in Hungary, all-powerful stimulus imparted to all the
energies of the nation through the revival of its ancient parliamentary
life. In Hungary, as well as in England, Parliament is the soul of the
body-politic. The stagnation of parliamentary life in Hungary from
1813 to 1825 was almost tantamount to the stagnation of all the other
intellectual energies of the nation. From 1825 onward, the National
Assembly met frequently; the Magyar language was again used in the
debates, and many reforms that had proved unrealizable in the hands of
private reformers, were carried out by the power of the nation assembled
in Parliament. The constant opposition offered to all reforms in Hungary,
at the hands of the Vienna government, only acted as a further stimulus
to the Hungarians; and within the five-and-twenty years of the present
period, Hungary advanced by leaps and bounds, both in its politic and
literary development.




CHAPTER XX.


The _rôle_ of Kazinczy as mentor and model for the younger generation
of his time was now allotted to a very gifted poet, Charles Kisfaludy,
brother of Alexander (see page 101). He was born in 1788, and like his
brother, became a soldier in the Austrian army. His proud father, on
learning that he had, in 1811, thrown up his military career, disowned
him; and Charles had to rough it in wild wanderings over Europe amidst
great privations. Yet his mind, singularly widened by the view and study
of European civilization, was thereby so strengthened and developed, that
on his return to his country (1817), he contrived to rise from abject
poverty to comparative comfort by his own literary exertions. His dramas,
some of which he wrote in the course of a few days, were at once so
intensely relished by the public, that Kisfaludy, who produced with equal
ease poetic works of lyric or epic character, quickly became the centre
of the literary life of Hungary. The “_Aurora_,” a literary periodical
founded by him in 1822, was enriched by the contributions of the
foremost writers, mostly his followers; and he himself was the rallying
personality for the new literary movement. Alas! his body, less elastic
than his mind, could never overcome the effects of his wanderings, and he
died of consumption in 1830.

In Kisfaludy the influence of the literary ideals of the French
and Germans is easily traceable. Like his models he was steeped in
romanticism and worship of the distant past. Yet he was saved from the
sickliness and namby-pambiness of many a German or French romantic poet
by his strong sense of humour. In his dramas (“_Stibor Vaida_,” “_Irén_,”
etc.) he frequently manifests strong dramatic vitality. It is in his
comedies and gay stories, that he excels. His humour is broad, subtle,
sympathetic and well worded. In his tragedies he did not succeed in
creating a type, this, one of the safest criteria of a poet’s genius.
In his comedies (“_Csalódások_” [“Disappointments”]; “_Kérők_” [“The
Wooers”]; “_Leányőrző_” [“Girl’s Guard”], etc.) on the other hand, he
has given types of undying vitality; such as “_Mokány_,” the rough,
humorous and honest young country squire. If we consider the fact here
so frequently alluded to, that social life in Hungary was up to the
thirties of this century exclusively life among the county-families in
the country, or in small towns; if, moreover, we remember that such
life on a small scale, where each person stands out in bold relief and
unencumbered by the numerous social mediocrities of large towns, is
the proper foster-earth of rich personalities: it will be easy to see,
that social life in Hungary in Kisfaludy’s youth was bristling with
delightfully original types of men and women. They only waited for the
hand of the poet to spring into their frames, and form valuable pictures.
Country-life and small towns in Hungary, to the present day, are full
of the most delightful types, both men and women; and the reputation
of a Dickens might have been acquired by him who would have told the
“adventures” and freaks of, for instance, the quaint, many-tongued sires
of the county of Sáros. Kisfaludy, with the true poet’s eye _saw_ those
types, and put them bodily on his canvas. They talk on his pages that
very language, full of savoury adjectives and verbal somersaults, that
they used when meeting at the halls of their friends, at the “Casino”
of the place or at the table in front of the Swiss _Confiserie_, in the
sleepy streets of their county capital. In his novels, “_Tollagi János_”
[a proper name]; “_Sulyosdi Simon_” [a proper name], etc., Kisfaludy has
recorded many a precious feature of the life of these sturdy, amiable,
enthusiastic, shrewd and simple country-gentry, in the midst of whom
moved the pathetic and lofty young girl; the coquettish and charming
young wife (or “little heaven,” “_mennyecske_” as the Hungarian word
has it); the quaint old maid, and the still quainter old bachelor. Here
Kisfaludy is at his best; and in showing his fellow-writers some of the
wealth to be found in their own country, he did Hungarian Literature and
Hungarian nationality an immense service. In some of his lyrical poems,
and especially in his truly majestic ode to the memory of the disaster
of Mohács (1526), written in dystichs, Kisfaludy is frequently more than
clever; in that ode he soars to the sublime. His “_Eprészleány_” (“Girl
Gleaning Strawberries”) is a charming idyll.




CHAPTER XXI.


The work of Kisfaludy was great. He charmed his readers, and thus
awakened an interest in Hungarian Literature in circles that had hitherto
been callous to the intellectual revival of their country. His vocation,
however, was limited. The Hungarians, by nature grave and given to
ponderous sentiments, needed, for a full awakening of their literary
life, more than the perfume of flowers. The rhythmic thunder of the
war-clarion; the majesty of the organ was needed. And the right man came.
The man, in whose sublime poems was heard the turmoil of the old glorious
wars, the symphony of love and patriotism, in tones of unprecedented
beauty. That man was Michael Vörösmarty (1800-1855). His life was devoted
entirely to the pursuit of literature, and in his soul there was only
one grand thought: to become Hungary’s troubadour, to kindle the holy
light of patriotism on the altar, and with the aid of the muses. In this
he was successful beyond all his predecessors. His were some of the
rarest qualities, the union of which goes to make the great poet. In
beauty and truly Magyar rhythm of language he was and largely still is
unsurpassed. His diction is, like his country, full of the majesty of
vast mountains, and the loveliness of flower-clad meadows sloping down to
melodious rivers. Without being a reckless innovator of words, his works
read at the first appearance as if written in a new language. As when
the student of Hellenic antiquity, after years spent with engravings of
old Greek art, comes for the first time to see one of the still extant
remains of that art itself: so felt the contemporaries of Vörösmarty
when the glorious hexameters of his epic, “_Zalán futása_” first struck
their ears. There was at last, not only this or that instrument of the
orchestra of Hungarian language; there was heard, not only the wails of
the ’cello of Kölcsey; the musical cascades of the clarinet of Charles
Kisfaludy; the wafting chords of the harp of Berzsenyi; or the gossamer
oboe of Csokonai: there was heard the unison and harmonious struggle
of all the instruments of the great idiom. Like the composers of the
immortal symphonies, Vörösmarty wielded the resources of the Magyar
language, intensifying the effect of each instrument by the parallel or
counter-quires of the other instruments. In his love-songs you hear
not only the notes of the melody, but also, as in the songs of his
Austrian contemporary, Schubert, the undercurrents of the melody in the
accompaniment. The wealth of poetic figures in Vörösmarty is surprising;
yet a chaste moderation tempers all undue exuberance. He is powerful,
not violent; imposing, not fierce. He writes mostly Largos; but there
are very few _longeurs_ in them. The quick pulsation of the drama does
not suit him; the epic and ode are his favourite forms. For, in him is
much of the priest, of the seer of a nation. In the depth of his reticent
heart he feels the whole life of his nation, and smarts unspeakably from
its then degradation. Too proud to indulge in constant moanings, he is
yet in an agony of rage and indignation at the oppression of his people.
But this holy anger goes forth from him sculptured in songs, swelling
with abiding life of beauty and power.

Vörösmarty’s poetic vocation was, if not aroused, yet, undoubtedly,
guided into the right direction by an epic of one Alexander Székely, a
Unitarian preacher, entitled “The Szekler in Transylvania” (“_A Székelyek
Erdélyországban_”), in which a not infelicitous attempt was made to work
into one national song the ancient Magyar legends and mythology. An
epic is the song of a nation whose critical dangers are not yet over.
It may be said, without exaggeration, that heroic Wolfe in driving the
French out of Canada (1759), drove out the last chance of the Americans
for anything like a great national epic. In gaining their independence
a few years after Wolfe’s success, the Americans also obtained perfect
security. There was no serious enemy left to jeopardize their existence.
The Indians could and did annoy them much; they could not seriously call
their very existence in question. Hence the Indian tales of Fenimore
Cooper are the only epics of the Americans. In Hungary matters stood
quite differently. There the very existence of the nation was doubtful.
A catastrophe might occur at any time. And in the terrible anguish of
that “gigantic death” (“_nagyszerü halál_”), of which Vörösmarty sings
in his “_Szózat_” (national hymn), the people of Hungary needed more
than a drama or an ode can give. It needed a national poem of large
dimensions in which the glories of the past were held up to the people
as an incitement to the conquest of the trophies of the future; in which
the powers of the Divine were shown to have a personal interest in the
destinies of the nation; and in which the sacred language of thirty
generations of patriots glows in all the victorious beauty of perfection.
When in 1748 Klopstock published his great epic, the “_Messias_,” he too
desired to do his country a patriotic service. His aim was, however,
at once larger and smaller than that of Vörösmarty. He meant chiefly
to weld for the Germans the weapon of a better language. Beyond this
he meant his epic for any nation whatever, its subject-matter being of
universal acceptance amongst Christian nations. Not so Vörösmarty. He
meant to write a Messianic epic, in which the Messiah was the Hungarian
nation itself. He wanted to raise up a particular nation, his nation,
to the consciousness of its force, of its vocation. And thus, while the
intellectual scope of his poem was much more limited than that of either
Milton or Klopstock, the intensity of its purport far exceeded both.

The name of the epic was, “The Flight of Zalán” (“_Zalán futása_”). It
appeared in 1825, or in the year when the national Parliament reassembled
after twelve long years’ adjournment, and when the nation, at any rate,
many of the best men of the nation, were in feverish expectancy of the
rise of New Hungary. Its subject is taken from the history of Árpád the
Conqueror, and centres in the Battle of Alpár, in which Árpád defeats his
most fearful enemy, Zalán, one of the Bulgarian rulers of the territory
between the Danube and the Tisza (Theiss) rivers. There are in the poem
three parallel streams of epic deeds, which, like the three choruses of
string, reed and brass instruments in an orchestra, join in one powerful
symphony. Árpád, the great duke and father of his people, fights Zalán,
and especially his herculean general Viddin. Ete, the young and romantic
Magyar knight fights Csorna, the diabolic Bulgarian hero; and in the
heavens “_Hadúr_” (“God of the war,” a name introduced by Székely),
the national god of the Magyars, fights and conquers “_Ármány_,” the
arch-fiend. The element of love is represented by Ete, who loves Hajna,
the beautiful daughter of an old Hungarian hero. She is also courted by
a divine charmer, whose temptations, however, she rejects, and from whom
she receives an enchanted horse. A large portion of the epic is taken up
with the description of single combats between the heroes. In the end,
the Hungarians are (as in reality they were) victorious, and Zalán flees
from his country.

There is undoubtedly much Ossianic misty glamour in Vörösmarty’s great
epic; and the figures of its leading heroes do not stand out with all
the desirable plasticity from among the multitude of minor heroes and
mythologic divinities. Yet Ete and Hajna are suffused with all the
charms of youth, love and heroism; and in Hadúr and Ármány two powerful
mythological types are placed before us. Árpád himself answers very well
the chief purpose of the poem, in that he is rather the incarnation of a
nation strong, noble, God-fearing and conquering, than the representative
of any special personality. Perhaps the least endowed figure of the poem
is Zalán, in whom the poet might have represented, in contrast to Árpád,
the various enemies endangering Hungary’s existence, and of whom he
only made a proud and despairing prince. Yet, after allowing for these
shortcomings—very natural in a work written in eleven months—“_Zalán
futása_” is a truly great epic. The splendour of its language, in regard
to which it is fully the equal of “Paradise Lost,” fell upon its first
readers with the spell of the Fata Morgana of the Hungarian _pusztas_
or prairies, on the lonely traveller. There was one general feeling:
“such language had not yet risen from any Hungarian lyre!” (“_igy még
nem zenge magyar lant_!”). A nation whose past could inspire such epic
music, was a nation of imposing resourcefulness. Only great nations,
after conquering great dangers, can produce great epics. A great epic is
not alone a literary event; as such it would redound mostly to the glory
of the author. It is a national event, and redounds chiefly to the glory
of the nation. It is the symptom and warrant of national greatness; of
that noble enthusiasm—without which, numerous factories and railways can
be built indeed, but no fabric of a national commonwealth holding its own
amidst roaring seas of danger and adversity. Vörösmarty’s epic poured
into the Hungarians that Belief and Confidence, that Eternality of Hope,
which alone steels nations against fate. Széchenyi had connected Buda,
the capital of the past, with Pesth, the capital of modern Hungary, by
means of a gigantic suspension bridge. Vörösmarty now connected Hungary’s
past with her future by the rainbow of his immortal epic.

In addition to “The Flight of Zalán,” Vörösmarty enriched Hungarian
Literature with several other smaller epics, such as “_Széplak_,”
“_Cserhalom_,” and the exquisite “The Two Neighbouring Castles” (“_Két
szomszéd vár_”). After 1831 he ceased writing epics. He had a real
passion for dramatic poetry, and although in “_Csongor és Tünde_” alone
he contrived to write a drama of superior finish, yet he continually
tried his hand at that form of poetry (“_Vérnász_”) (“The Sanguinary
Wedding”); “Marótbán” (Banus Marót); “_Áldozat_” (The Sacrifice), etc.
His lyrical poetry, on the other hand, contains priceless gems. Adorning,
as he did, even the smallest of his lyrical poems with the unrivalled
splendour of his diction; he reaches in some of them, and first of all
in the majestic “National Hymn” (“_Szózat_”, 1837), the highest level
of poetic _élan_. In these select poems, while still singing nothing but
the hopes and glories of his nation, he becomes so European in tone and
chaste beauty of form, that his work will lose little of its perfection
by fair translations into other European languages. In them there is felt
the breath of that civilization of Greater Hellas, or Europe, which was
originally that of Hellas proper. Nor does his lyric muse move in grave
and solemn moods alone. In his famous “Song of Fót” (“_Fóti dal_”), he
has left the wine-drinking community of the world a model song in praise
of the noble child of Bacchus. He likewise succeeded in writing poetic
apotheoses of some of the great Hungarians of his time, such as Liszt,
the great musician, and in the composition of small narrative poems,
which prove him to have been endowed with a keen sense of humour (“_Mák
Bandi_”; “_Laboda_;” “_Petike_;” “_Gábor deák_”). His great activity as a
creative poet did not prevent him from writing a considerable number of
articles for literary periodicals, such as the “_Tudományos Gyűjtemény_,”
“_Kritikai Lapok_” (edited by Bajza), and for the new “_Aurora_,” and the
“_Athenæum_.” He was also one of the translators of the “Thousand and One
Nights,” and of some of Shakespeare’s plays.




CHAPTER XXII.


The national and literary current of which Vörösmarty was the chief
exponent brought several other great epic works to the surface. Andreas
Horvát de Pázmánd (1778-1839) was working for many years at a national
epic in twelve long cantos, singing the history of Árpád the conqueror.
In 1831, at last, he published the huge poem which, however, was
distanced and soon silenced by the masterwork of Vörösmarty. It certainly
helped both to set off “The Flight of Zalán” still more strongly, and
also to widen the circle of old Magyar mythology.

An epic poet of far superior merit was Gregory Czuczor (1800-1866). Had
he not been a monk, and so lost much of the vivifying contact of civil
life, he might have soared very high. It must be, however, added that his
conflict both with poverty and with the Austrian Government, did make
up largely for the lack of experiences of romantic, conjugal and family
conflicts. His was a vigorous, systematic and finely discerning mind.
To the epic he felt attracted not only by the general literary tone of
his time, but by his personal bent for popular or rather folk-poetry. The
_naïveté_ of the latter, which forms its distinctive feature, is also one
of the chief elements of the epic. Among Czuczor’s epics, “_Botond_,”
in four cantos, is the best. It tells part of the life of that famous
Hungarian hero of the time of the conquest. Botond had brought home from
his Byzantine campaigns a charming Greek girl, Polydora. One of the
Magyar heroes, Bödölény, who also loves Polydora, takes her secretly back
to Constantinople. Now Botond again invades the Greek Empire, and with
his huge war-club breaks a hole in the gate of the capital. In the end
he gets back Polydora. This simple plot is enlivened with recitals not
only of military and heroic exploits, but also of touching love-episodes.
The contrast between burly, brave Botond and the refined Greek maid, the
episodes in which Szende, the page occurs, and the beautifully rolling
hexameters lend a peculiar charm to this epic. Perhaps now, after the
realization of most of the ardent political hopes of Czuczor’s age,
his epic will be considered even as much better than at the time of
its appearance when it had to compete with the more fiery epic muse of
Vörösmarty. Of Czuczor’s linguistic works we have already made mention
(see page 112).

A contemporary of Czuczor, John Garay (1812-1853), although not a
poet of great distinction, must be here mentioned, on account of the
popularity of his innumerable ballads and similar epic poetry, covering
almost every one of the memorable events of Hungarian history. Rather a
rhetor than a poet, he wrote his ballads, of which “_Kont_” (relating to
the martyr-death of thirty Hungarian patriots at the hands of Emperor
Sigismund), is the best known, in an easy-flowing popular style. He
trusted rather to the attractiveness of the story itself than to his own
poetic genius. When well recited, many of his ballads are still very
effective.




CHAPTER XXIII.


Despite the very great advance made in the development of their
literature up to 1830, the Hungarians were still wanting in one of the
necessary elements of the growth of truly good works. Honest, just and
well-informed criticism was wanting. Kazinczy, it is true, had in his
extensive correspondence paid very careful attention to the critical
examination of the prosody and language of his friends and pupils.
Such external criticism, however, did not suffice. In a country, such
as Hungary, where Greek literature was then known only to exceedingly
few writers, the canons of criticism were easily neglected. Moreover,
literature being still considered more as a patriotic than a literary
function, poets did not, as a rule, tolerate even mild criticism. Yet
without such criticism, Hungarian Literature was likely to deteriorate.
Even men of genius are the better for good criticism. Yet they are the
exception; and to the vast number of writers with talent rather than
genius, criticism was, and always has been, the mentor whom they could
not afford to miss. It has been one of the great advantages of French
literature that its creative writers have nearly always been watched
by great critical writers. From Boileau and Diderot, to Sainte-Beuve,
the French have always had men of piercing and tasteful criticism,
who controlled the works of the purely spontaneous genius. Nor can
the literature of Germany congratulate itself on a more auspicious
circumstance than the fact of Lessing’s incomparable activity as a critic
at the very outset of the classical period. It is with regard to this
historic value of sound literary criticism, that we must appreciate the
work of the Hungarian writer forming the subject of the present chapter.

Joseph Bajza (1804-1858) had many of the qualities of a great critic. He
was courageous, especially in that courage which is perhaps the rarest,
the courage defying current opinions; he was learned; he possessed a
very keen sense of linguistic niceties and poetic forms; and, last not
least, he was no mean poet himself. Already in 1830 he gave signal
proof not only of his pure patriotism, but also of his penetrating
knowledge of the true needs of the then Hungarian Literature, by fiercely
attacking a plan, broached by a Hungarian publisher, to prepare a
Hungarian Encyclopædia (or “Conversations-Lexicon,” as, in imitation
of the well-known German publication, it was called) on lines, as Bajza
proved, unpatriotic, because unsuited to the character and stage of
Magyar literature of that time. This was the “Conversations-Lexicon
Quarrel.” In the same year, Bajza started his critical paper (“_Kritikai
Lapok_”), which was later on (1837) followed by his “_Athenæum_,” and
its appendix “_Figyelmező_.” In these periodicals he discoursed with
great verve and knowledge on the theories of various poetic forms;
and carefully criticised the works of his contemporaries. His chief
contributors were Vörösmarty and Toldy (then still Schedel), the former
a great poet, the latter (see p. 254) a great scholar. The authority of
Bajza made itself felt very soon; and the numerous polemics occasioned
by his articles only served to aggrandize his position as a critic.
Already in his essays on the epigram, the novel, the drama, etc., Bajza
had proved himself a constructive as against a purely negative critic.
In that capacity probably his chief merit is his elaboration of the
“theory” of the folk-poem. In Hungary, with her numerous peasantry,
there is an inexhaustible wealth of poems composed by unknown people,
exclusively peasants, shepherds, and similar inglorious poets. These
poems, invariably meant to be adapted to songs, are wafted over the
country like the mild breezes of spring, and like them, no one knows
their origin. In previous times, the rococo taste of enlightened pedants
had contemptuously ignored these blossoms of the wild _puszta_ (prairie).
Since Csokonai they were held in greater esteem; but it was Bajza who, by
framing them in the time-honoured formulæ of classical æsthetics, raised
them to a literary status. Since Bajza, the “_népdal_” or folk-song was
not only a matter of national delight or pride, but also of serious study.

To Bajza’s circle belonged the poets Alexander Vachott (1818-1861);
Frederick Kerényi (1822-1852), who died in America; Julius Sárosy
(1816-1861), the author of several stirring revolutionary poems; Andreas
Pap; Emeric Nagy; Sigismund Beöthy, etc.




CHAPTER XXIV.


The rapid growth of Hungarian Literature since 1825, shows chiefly in
works of poetry proper; that is, in verse. Hungarian prose had in the
first ten years of this period received no development similar to that
of Hungarian verse. Yet many a writer had tried his hand at the creation
of Hungarian literary prose. The reason of this belated advance of
Hungarian prose was owing mainly to the late introduction of the Magyar
language into the schools. Not before a language has hewn its way through
the thickets of philosophy, the subtleties of distinctions in physics
and chemistry, or the awkward bulkiness of historical facts, will it be
supple and flexible enough to do efficient service for the innumerable
needs of prose. Without a prose ready for all the turns and twists of
serious thought, great historical or philosophical works are almost
impossible. The difficulty was overcome in Hungary by applying prose
first to novels, and then to History or Philosophy. Novels and romances,
taking as they do the place of the epics in olden times, have also a
national or more than literary importance. And we find that nations
without great epics are also, as a rule, without great novels of their
own. The astounding progress made in Hungary in epic literature proper
bade fair to inaugurate the forthcoming of a novelistic literature.
Vörösmarty and Czuczor were soon to have their followers in prose—the
novelists. The frequency of rich types in Hungarian society could not
but favour that branch of literature. In fact, the greatest difficulty
for Hungarian novelists then, and to a large extent even now, was not
to discover and work out a good subject, but to hunt up a sufficient
number of readers. In the thirties and forties of this century, most of
the cultivated individuals in Hungary were so familiar with German and
even with French, that they could and did easily gratify their novelistic
appetites with the innumerable products from the pens of German and
French novelists. People will seldom relish or crave for lyric or epic
poems of nations other than their own. They will ordinarily prefer
homemade verse. With novels it is quite different. There is scarcely any
exaggeration in stating that Lord Lytton’s novels have been read more
extensively in Germany and Austria-Hungary than in England. The same
applies respectively to George Sand, the French, and Mme. Flygare-Carlén,
the Swedish novelist. Hungarian novelists had, therefore, to contend
against formidable competition from abroad. But there was another and
equally grave difficulty to conquer. The public in all countries has a
fatal tendency to take up one author as the “standard” author in a given
department of literature, and to give all other authors in the same
field the cold shoulder. The less intense the interest which the public
takes in that department, the more it will be inclined to believe in the
“standard” man. In Hungary, that evil tendency has wrought great injury
to novelists. At once a few of them became the “standard” novelists.
Nobody wanted to hear of any other. By this means the rise of other,
perhaps greater novelists, was retarded, if not altogether foreclosed;
and the “standard” man, eagerly seizing on the great favour bestowed upon
him, poured forth scores of novels, irrespective of the higher demands
of Art. The consequence was that he deteriorated. For one good novel he
gave ten bad ones. Having a sort of literary monopoly, he did not heed
adverse criticism. The public, on the other hand, did not care to learn
of a new novelist, and, as actually happened in Hungary, almost entirely
neglected a real genius for no other reason than that mental laziness,
which in countries with less abundant literature is perhaps one of the
most baneful of obstacles to the success of a writer.

The preceding remarks appear to be necessary for a right appreciation
of Hungarian novels. Foreign readers, and perhaps more especially the
English, are apt to admire in Hungarian novels such qualities as strike
them as new and “weird,” because German, French, or English novelists
do not excel in them. Thus foreign readers will easily be impressed,
and in many cases unduly so, by the great picturesqueness of Hungarian
novelists. This quality, commendable though it no doubt is, will induce
many a foreign critic to overrate the value of this or that Hungarian
novel. In Hungary, picturesque turns of phrases are of the very
commonest. They do not strike a Hungarian critic as being particularly
meritorious. Hence the reader of the present work must not be astonished
at some of the subsequent severe judgments passed on Hungarian novelistic
celebrities. Far from trying to deter English or French readers from
the reading of such novels as they will find criticised adversely, we
would rather advise them to enjoy those novels without further regard to
the views of the writer. We have in so criticising of necessity placed
ourselves on a basis rather Magyar than European, and we are fully aware
of the marked difference in taste to be found in the various nations
of Europe. If the novelists and poets of one nation were to be judged
by the taste of another, Thackeray could hardly be regarded as a great
novelist, and Tennyson scarcely as a great poet. Yet both are in England
recognized as two of the best writers in English literature.

Of the great novelists of Hungary, four stand out as peculiarly
excellent. Their names are Nicolas Jósika; Joseph Eötvös; Sigismund
Kemény; and Maurus Jókai. The first three belong to the class of
Magnates, being Barons; the last is a commoner by birth. It is rather
curious, that the Magnates, who have in the present century given no poet
of the first order to Hungary, should in the field of Hungarian novel
writing have furnished three writers of the first rank, of whom one,
Baron Kemény, has done work not unworthy of the greatest novel-writer of
the century.

The first of the four to attract general attention in Hungary was
Baron Joseph Jósika. He was born in 1794 at Torda, in Transylvania.
Having spent many years in the military service of Austria, and in
travels abroad, he retired in 1818 and withdrew to Transylvania, where
he pursued historic and literary studies, relating chiefly to his own
province. Transylvania harbours many of the most glorious traditions
of Hungarian history. For generations, especially in the seventeenth
century, it was practically the only home of Magyardom. There is no lack
of romantic, picturesque, or startling facts in the public or social
life of that country; and Jósika, whose heart had, through his first
luckless marriage, learned the depths of sorrow, as through his second
wife he learned the bliss of true love, Jósika was in a position to do
full justice to the wealth of picturesque characters and scenery in
Transylvania’s past. His first novel, “_Abafi_,” was published in 1836,
and at once received general applause on the part of the critics, and,
what was still more important, at the hands of the public. Its subject
is taken from the troubled times of Sigismund Bátori, when Turks,
Austrians and Magyars, were fighting and intriguing for the possession of
Transylvania, in the last two decades of the sixteenth century. Bátori’s
mighty and tainted personality, with all his cruelty, heroism, astuteness
and audacity, is, together with that of the Turkish conquerors, pashas,
and court people, the personal background to the hero of the novel,
Oliver Abafi, who rises from conduct dissipated and lawless, to the
heights of noble self-sacrifice. The story is told with great power of
description and impersonation. The reader cannot fail to feel as if quite
at home in that agitated corner of Europe, where some of the historic
agencies met in deadly conflict, and where men and women breathed much
of that grand air of great events, which colours them in tints unknown
to the people of less eventful times. The novel is intensely interesting
and will convey a more life-like picture of its period than many a dull
historic volume.

Equal to, and if possible, even more fascinating, is Jósika’s novel,
“The Bohemians in Hungary” (“_A csehek Magyarországban_”). This novel
goes back to older times still. It pictures the state of Hungary in the
middle of the fifteenth century, when the Bohemian (Czech) Hussites were
invading Hungary. Of all the innumerable sects and heresies from the end
of the twelfth century to the rise of Protestantism, the Hussites were no
doubt the most powerful. From the depths of the forests ranging round the
river Main, to the mountains encircling Hungary and Transylvania, these
heroic and fanatic warriors spread the terror of their name. But for
some grave political mistakes and unforeseen reverses of Vitovt, one of
the greatest of the historic Slavs (flourished 1380 to 1430), who wanted
to found a Slav empire, reaching from the western confines of Bohemia,
to the walls of holy Moscow, the Slavs, on the basis of Hussitism, and
under leaders like Ziska, and the Procops, might have for ever reduced
the historic _rôle_ of Germany to that of a small power. Theirs would
then have been a great empire, strongly unified in language, creed and
traditions. No Austria would have been possible; and Hungary would have
probably been submerged in the Slav flood. It is the story of the lives
of some of these wild and terrible Czechs in the north and north-west
of Hungary which forms the subject of the powerful novel of Jósika.
The castles of the Czech leaders were real fortresses of Slavdom, and
the population of those parts of Hungary being largely Slav to the
present day, the danger for Hungary was very great. Fortunately for the
independence of the Magyars, their young king Matthew Corvinus, son of
John Hunyadi, was a match for the Bohemians. One by one he destroyed
their castles, liberating thousands of prisoners, and ridding the
country of the Slav invasion. His illustrious figure shines in Jósika’s
novel like the youthful emblem of that historic vitality which has kept
Hungary in a ruling position over Slav and Germanic tribes these last
thousand years. The picturesqueness of Jósika’s novel is extraordinary.
Male and female characters of intense fascination move in the castles,
battlefields, dungeons and mountain-paths described by the novelist.
Komoróczy, the knight and robber; the glorious king and his romantic
love; Elemér, the hero, called “the Eagle”; the charming widow, who
defies with a dimpled smile the most ruthless of amorous men; Jews, at
once grand in suffering and commonplace in their greed; all these and
many more scenes and portraits reconstruct that memorable time when the
Renascence was rising over the dying gloom of the Middle Ages.

It is impossible to tell here, even very briefly, the plots and
characters of the very numerous novels written by Jósika both in Hungary
and at Dresden, whither he retired after escaping the Austrians, who
had sentenced him to death as one of the prominent members of the
Hungarian “rebels.” All these novels are historic in subject, and even
quote, sometimes, chapter and verse from the chronicles on which they
are based. The most famous are “_Esther_;” “_Francis Rákóczy II._,” the
hero of which is the most popular of all Hungarian princes who ever
revolted from the Habsburgs; “A Hungarian Family during the Revolution”
(“_Egy magyar család a forradalom alatt_”); “The Last Báthory” (“_As
utolsó Báthory_”). Jósika is easily compared to and measured by Walter
Scott. Yet there is in the very tendencies of their works a marked
difference. Scott, in writing his novels, was prompted more by his
literary tastes and proclivities than by any consideration of politic
aims. Both Scotland and England were during his life-time (1771-1832)
at the height of their triumphal career. His novels were romantic work
pure and simple. England being at the head of the powers combating the
French Revolution, her literary geniuses, too, followed lines opposed to
modern Liberalism; in other words, they became romantic. Hungary, on the
other hand, was, during the life-time of Jósika, an oppressed country,
and after a short period of glory during her war of independence, she
vegetated for over ten years in a torpor caused by a fiercely reactionary
government. Into Jósika’s novels, therefore, there necessarily entered
a political element, which coloured his work with a tint unknown to the
great Scotchman’s tales. And this, together with the circumstance of
his becoming rapidly a “standard” novelist, explains Jósika’s literary
eminence and also his literary failings. In his attempt to use the story
of Hungary’s past as a means of reviving her present, he naturally
lost sight of some of the purely literary laws of novel-writing. His
characters being already given by history, he neglected to elaborate
their psychology. Events happen rather unto or by them, than through
them. The inner machinery of motives is sometimes clumsy or too flimsy.
Being much in demand as a “standard” novelist, he wrote much; too
much. Yet with all these occasional shortcomings, Jósika is one of the
most splendid novelists of the picturesque class. Few Hungarian books
recording Hungary’s past will give the foreign reader a more pleasing
and, at the same time, instructive picture of the romantic days of that
great country. The professorial critic, reposing on the tattered laurels
of his victims, if not on his own, will find much to rebuke in Jósika.
The youth of Hungary and the unprejudiced foreigner will always read him
with delight.




CHAPTER XXV.


The second great novelist in that period was Eötvös. Born in 1813, he
received a careful education, and after extensive travels in western
Europe, embraced the judicial career for a time. When still a young
man, at the age of six-and-twenty, he published his first great novel,
“The Carthusian” (“_A Karthauzi_,” 1839-40). This remarkable work had
an immense effect. It was read with equal delight in the palaces of the
magnates, and in the closets of the middle-class people. It charmed the
young and moved the old. It seemed to express the very innermost cravings
and mental propensities of the then Hungarian public. More than that.
It expressed a state of feeling then almost universal on the continent
of Europe. Like Goethe’s “_Werther_,” it lent expression to what lay
dormant and unexpressed in the hearts of millions of Europeans. The
sultry atmosphere then weighing on continental Europe had engendered a
morbid melancholy in many a high-strung man and woman. Life seemed to
be full of unsolved and unsolvable problems; full of forces disruptive
and disintegrating, causing unease uncertainty and distress. All the
nobler efforts of men in building up their private or public fortunes
appeared to be blighted and marred by the demoniac perverseness of the
political and social powers of the time. A brooding meditativeness
seized people, and fresh and vigorous deeds being impossible, pale
and despondent reflections embroiled men in a dumb struggle against
destiny. Such was the mental temper of a very large class of men and
women in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Italy. Eötvös himself
had, from early youth, been given to that morbid meditativeness and
self-destructive sensitiveness of the age; and the sorrowful condition
of his country only increased his pathetic melancholy. Hungarian young
men and women, then and now, are naturally very much more pathetic and
grave than the youth of any other country. They have neither the virile
alacrity of the British youth so agreeably manifested in the games and
muscular amusements of young England; nor the precocious polish and
gaiety of French youths. Theirs is a heavy mood, similar to that of the
_Largos_ of Hungarian music, but followed by no _Friss_ or _Vivace_.
To souls tuned in such minor keys, the “_Karthauzi_” came as the very
revelation of their deepest secrets. Hitherto the epics and novels
written in Hungary had been retrospective work. They narrated the woes
and joys, the troubles and glories of past ages. In Eötvös’ novel there
was, practically for the first time, a work of introspective _actualité_;
a work appealing to the reader himself, and not only to his historic
imagination. The queries tormenting the young men and women of that age
were here subjected to an analysis full of psychological inquisitiveness,
enveloped in the gloaming of poetic descriptions of Nature. The plot
of the novel is of the simplest. Gustavus, a French nobleman, in whose
agitated soul are accumulated all the tempest-laden clouds of his age,
seeks in vain to find peace and consolation in Love, Pleasure and
Ambition. Julia, his first love, deserts him for an unworthy “other one;”
Betti, his second love, he rejects himself. And so, tossed from one rock
of discord to the other, he finally enters the order of the Carthusians,
and there, amidst steady work and in firm faith, finds the only solution
that can await characters like his: Death. Goethe, with the terrible
serenity of judgment so peculiar to him, once remarked, that there are,
as he called them, “problematic characters, who can do justice to no
situation in which they may be placed.” Such a character is Gustavus. But
such was also the general and typical character of his time; and hence
the immense effect of the novel. Even the chief and serious deficiency of
the novel, being as it was, the deficiency of numerous Hungarian minds
of that time, only helped to increase its popularity. Eötvös could never
quite overcome the inner contrast between his Franco-German education and
the Magyar character of his works. Of all the great Hungarian writers,
his language is the least Magyar in form and savour. The European
and the Magyar were constantly battling in him and frequently to the
detriment of the latter. His was not that power of blending European and
national culture into a new and harmonious composition. That power is
distinctively the characteristics of the classical writers of nations.
It belongs only to the highest form of genius. But the reading public of
the “_Karthauzi_” was largely recruited from amongst people in whom that
conflict between western and Magyar culture had likewise not been brought
to a harmonious issue. They thus found in the great novel that very
failing of their own class, without which, according to Grillparzer’s
profound remark, success is hardly obtainable in any profession.

In 1845, Eötvös published another great novel: “The Village Notary”
(“_A falu jegyzője_”). It was meant to be a scathing satire on the
corruption, backwardness and general administrative misery of public
county life in Hungary. Eötvös, whose conceptions of the state and its
organs were formed largely after the models of German, Austrian and
French organizations, was deeply convinced of the utter insufficiency
of that local selfgovernment, which in Hungary had nearly always been
one of greater independence than that even of England. In Hungary all
the leading and influential officials in the counties were elective, and
from among the noble class of the county only. Being more than underpaid,
they frequently abused their power, and contrived to secure a relatively
large income by means of exactions and terrorizations of all kinds. The
typical figure of these squires was the _szolgabiró_, or under-sheriff,
as he may be termed, if with inaccuracy, who presided over nearly all the
public affairs of one of the districts into which counties are divided.
His administration was frequently carried on pasha fashion indeed; and
the poorer classes were much at his mercy. Eötvös, who thought that the
strongly centralized and systematized organization of French or German
local governments was undoubtedly much superior to the system obtaining
in Hungary, published his novel with the intention of bringing about a
change in public opinion, and so finally a change in the county-system
itself. To the immense benefits accruing to the Hungarians as a nation
through the very system of local selfgovernment which Eötvös so cruelly
exposed, he was insensible. That county-life, in spite of all its crying
abuses, was the only and indispensable preliminary schooling for the
functions of government in council or parliament; that these rough
and uncultured county-gentry in Hungary, as well as their brethren in
England, were far better fitted for some of the most important tasks of
government and politics than the most methodic and punctual official
in French or German local offices, to all that Eötvös paid no serious
attention. His warm-hearted love of Equality and Right made him boil over
at the sight of many an injustice—at the hands of men whose inferiority
in point of knowledge and western culture rendered them easy objects
of contempt to one who gauged all political greatness by the standard
of France or Germany. Eötvös, the politician, entertained of course
the same ideas about the value of the old Hungarian county-system, as
did Eötvös the novelist. He was a “centralist”; and the number of his
followers has been very great to the present day. They still maintain
that even the present remnants of the old county-system in Hungary are
very injurious to the Magyar state; and that nothing short of a total
overhauling, or—to talk plainly—abolition of that system, and the
introduction of French centralization in its lieu can save the kingdom
of St. Stephen. In more recent times the historic work of Béla Grünwald
on the social and political condition of Hungary from 1711 to 1825 (“_A
régi Magyarország_”) has elaborated the ideas of Eötvös with the armoury
of learned footnotes and systematic chapters. The novel of Eötvös is
still the text of all the loud centralists in Hungary, to whom the county
selfgovernment is an absurd anachronism. As a matter of fact, on the
continent, Hungary is the only country where local selfgovernment is
still extant. Nor can there be any doubt, that that local selfgovernment
alone enabled the Magyars to hold their supremacy over the numerically
stronger nations in their country. Taking the British constitution as the
model of all representative government, we cannot go astray in claiming
for such government three absolutely indispensable elements. First, a
parliament proper, consisting of two Chambers or Houses; secondly, a
cabinet proper; and thirdly, two or three real and energetic political
parties, the numerous members of which take an intense interest in every
one of the political issues of the day. Applying this standard to the
United States, for instance, we find, that the Americans while having a
federal, two-chambered parliament and also two or more genuine parties,
yet have no Cabinet proper; and hence many of the features of political
corruption that were rampant in England in the times from Charles II.
to George III., when the Cabinet was still forming, and not yet formed,
may be noticed in the United States at the present day. In the same way
France has a Cabinet indeed, and also a two-chambered parliament; but
genuine political parties, with members intensely interested in politics,
are wanting. Hence the instability and irregularity of the French
representative government. In Hungary, and there alone, the student of
politics will find a perfect replica of the British constitution, in
that the fine superstructure of Parliament and Cabinet is based on the
broad pedestal of genuine political parties. The members of these parties
take a real, passionate and untiring interest in political questions of
any kind, and hence there is a real public opinion, a real nation. This
basis of the political life in Hungary, where has it been quarried from
but in the local selfgovernment of the counties? Interest in the mostly
arid questions of politics can be acquired only by early and constant
contact with men who make it almost the chief interest of their lives. It
is in the county halls, and in the social reunions of the county-gentry,
that the young Magyars learn the great lesson of dispensing authority,
commanding respect and discussing public business with tact and prudence.
It is there that men were formed who could at all times find resources
to withstand the anti-national policy of the Habsburgs or the occasional
rebellions of the Slav or Roumanian peasantry. Of the country-gentlemen
in Hungary indeed may be said, what Macaulay wrote of the English esquire
of the seventeenth century: that “his ignorance and uncouthness, his low
tastes and gross phrases, would, in our time, be considered as indicating
a nature and a breeding thoroughly plebeian. Yet he was essentially a
patrician, and had, in large measure, both the virtues and vices which
flourish among men set from their birth in high place, and accustomed to
authority, to observance and to self-respect.” (_History of England_,
Ch. III.) It was amongst these rough squires that the two great parties
of England were formed. It was likewise amongst the much derided
_táblabirók_ and _szolgabirók_ (squires and justices) of Hungary, that
the men of 1825 and 1848 were formed; and in our time they have given
Hungary one of the indispensable elements of representative government:
real political parties.

It appears necessary to dwell at some length on the great historic and
political questions underlying the famous novel of Eötvös. No doubt,
every Hungarian cannot but wish to see that novel in the hands of all who
take an interest in Hungary. For, “The Village Notary” contains capital
portraits of many a quaint, wild or pathetic type of inner Hungary.
The down-trodden notary (Tengelyi); the tyrannical _szolgabiró_ (or
squire) Paul Nyúzó (meaning: flayer); Viola, the honest peasant, who
being shamefully wronged betakes himself to the forest and _pusztas_
(prairies) to lead the life of a robber; Mrs. Réty, the wife of the chief
magistrate of the county, who is entangled in a fearful domestic tragedy,
etc., etc. Moreover, the novel contains excellent pieces of irony and
satire; and being reared on the broad idea of social reform never sinks
to mere pamphleteering. Yet, with all that, we cannot but protest against
the misstatement of the political importance of county-life in Hungary
as advanced in that novel. Fully acknowledging, as we do, its literary
value, which is diminished only by the heavy and un-Magyar diction, we
deprecate its judgment on an institution without which Hungary would have
long been reduced to the level of a mere province of Austria. Eötvös,
like most idealists bred in the school of German idealism, could not
endure rough Reality. He forgot, that for the making of history, as for
that of bread, unclean matter is, at certain stages, an indispensable
element.

We have two more novels by Eötvös: “Hungary in 1514” (“_Magyarország
1514 ben_,” 1847), which is a fair picture of the time of the
peasant-rebellion in Hungary, under George Dózsa; and “The Sisters” (“_A
nővérek_,” 1857), a feeble story with many ideas on Education.

On Eötvös, as a writer on politics, and the Philosophy of History, see
page 251. It may here be mentioned that Eötvös, who was President of the
Academy, was frequently called upon to deliver commemorative discourses
on the lives and merits of deceased members of the Academy and the
Kisfaludy Society (see page 113). His speeches are, as a rule, of great
oratorical power, and illuminated with grand conceptions of Life and
Literature. He was eminently an orator, not a rhetor; and although he
seldom reached the magnificence of Kölcsey (see page 107), he is no
unworthy follower of him.




CHAPTER XXVI.


At the present day most people of culture outside Hungary know the name
of Jókai, the Hungarian novelist; few, if any, know the name of Sigismund
Kemény. Yet, of the two, Kemény is probably the greater writer. He is the
Balzac of Hungary, less Balzac’s fame. For, strange to say, in Hungary
itself, the novels of Kemény are very little known; and although several
Magyar critics of the highest authority have declared Kemény to be the
greatest novelist of the Hungarians, yet the reading public in Hungary
neither buys nor reads the masterpieces of the Transylvanian baron. This
lack of general appreciation seems to be somewhat inherent in the very
kind of genius possessed by men like Balzac and Kemény. The former, it
is true, has a well-known name, and his works have spread over Europe
and America. Yet, even in France, the full grandeur of his genius has
not yet been recognized. Balzac has, as yet, no statue in Paris, which
city he has described more ingeniously than any other writer. Even in
his native town of Tours his statue was erected only in quite recent
times. The _Académie_ has never admitted him within her circle; and the
French are not yet aware that in Balzac they have their Shakespeare in
prose. Indeed, nobody short of Shakespeare will stand comparison with the
gigantic genius of Balzac. Both have created a long series of grand types
of humanity endowed with an undying life and charm of their own. To both
the secrets and puzzles of the human soul were transparent; and both had
the powers of philosophic analysis and poetic synthesis in equal shares.
Shakespeare, too, had to bide his time; and twenty-eight years after his
death, John Milton does not even mention his dramas as necessary reading
for a young gentleman’s education. Considering, then, the fate of Balzac
in France, with an eager reading public immeasurably more numerous than
that of Hungary, we need not wonder that Kemény suffered with tenfold
intensity from the drawbacks peculiar to his Balzacian genius.

We said, Kemény is the Balzac of Hungary. We did not say, he was equal to
Balzac. In Hungary a full-fledged Balzac can as yet not be expected. No
amount of native genius will enable a man to overcome obstacles such as
stand in the way of him who should undertake to do for Hungarian society
what Balzac did for French. The France of Louis-Philippe was infinitely
better adapted to the writing of its “_Comédie humaine_,” than the
Hungary of Kemény’s time.

Hungary is far from being as homogeneous as is France. In the latter
country, despite much variety in language and social institutions, there
is one pervading common spirit in all classes and peoples of the state.
Whether Norman or Gascon, the citizen of France is chiefly a Frenchman,
with distinctly French ideas and sentiments. France is the country
of the French. Hungary is not the country of the Hungarians; it is a
trysting-place of nations rather than the country of one nation. There
are not only classes and ranks, but each class or rank differs according
to the nation it belongs to. The Magyar _bourgeois_ is not like the Slav
_bourgeois_; and both differed, especially in Kemény’s time, from the
German _bourgeois_. No one, certainly not Kemény, can claim an intimate
knowledge of all the nations in Hungary; and thus no one has, as yet, so
profoundly impregnated himself with as immense an array of social facts
as had Balzac before he wrote his great novels. Balzac knew the entire
anatomy and physiology of the peasant, the soldier, the clergyman, the
provincial, the Parisian, the maid, the _concierge_, the _bourgeoise_,
the _grande dame_, the actress, the scholar, the lawyer, the speculator,
the _viveur_, the diplomatist—in short, of every shade of character that
went to form French society. In Hungary, such a knowledge could not be
acquired. Familiarity with ten to twelve languages is required to know
the full anatomy and physiology of the peasants in Hungary alone. To
do, therefore, for Hungarian society what Balzac had done for French;
to write the Hungarian “_Comédie humaine_” has so far been practically
impossible; nor did Kemény do it. And yet, within the narrow limits of
his arena, Kemény worked with the spirit and genius of Balzac. That
his capacity was essentially akin to that of the great French writer
there can be no doubt. It was not of the same comprehensiveness. Balzac
had humour and wit; Kemény had none. Balzac had an exquisite sense
of proportion, if not always in his style, at least always in the
architecture of his plot; Kemény had not. Balzac was an encyclopædist of
the human heart, in that he knew women as well as men; Kemény knew men
far better than women. Balzac’s range of observation being greater, his
mind was subtler even than that of Kemény. Yet, with all that, Kemény’s
genius was essentially akin to that of Balzac. He, too, had that vast
knowledge of historic events and that interest in scientific researches
that suggested to Balzac innumerable shades and innuendoes of thought,
and _aperçus_ on every form and phase of life. Kemény, like Balzac,
had studied much in books and nature and man; he also had that love
of realism—that following up of mental or emotional waves into their
minutest recesses in the face or voice or gestures of persons. The
outward or material appearance of man: his dress, house, arms, art-work,
or contrivances were a matter of profound study to Kemény, as they were
to Balzac. Although intensely analytical, he is equally great at and
fond of descriptions. He paints nature, more especially that of his
beloved Transylvania, as one intimate with mountains, rivers and forests.
He knows their language and physiognomy; his landscapes are like the
choruses in Greek tragedies. They form part of the scenes; not only of
the scenery. They are like the contrapuntal bass to the melodies of his
novels. But in what Kemény resembles Balzac most is his inexorableness.
There is no other word for it. In nearly all his novels, as in most of
those of Balzac, man is crushed down pitilessly, remorselessly. Without
making any deliberate show of pessimism, Kemény is intensely pessimistic.
As in Balzac the overpowering demon of modern times is money, after
which all crave, all run and rush, jostling, panting, jading; so in
Kemény, the bane of man appears under the form of those small mistakes
and errors which dig the grave of all hopes. The great passions, vices
and crimes do not, in Kemény’s novels, act as the causes of the final
downfall of his heroes or heroines. His heroes do not die from strokes
of lightning, shooting forth from the black clouds of their terrible
passions or heinous crimes. On the contrary: such lightnings rather
illumine their road to success. They end, as it were, through a fire
caused by a carelessly dropped match. The ghastly irony of real life,
which no unbiassed observer can have failed to notice, is shown in
his novels in all its terrible working. The melancholy of Eötvös is
sweet and soothing; the gloom of Kemény is discomforting, distressing,
just because Kemény never seems to be deliberately pessimistic. While
reading his novels, the reader is so struck with the beauty of those
gems of original and profound ideas and remarks, which Kemény strews in
prodigious abundance over the objects and persons of his novels, that
the persistent gloom and despair dominating nearly all his works, do not
become so painful to the reader. It is when we have finished the book;
when we overlook the whole of the plan; when we have laid our ear on the
throbbing heart of each of the persons with whom we had been through
several volumes; it is when the novel in its entirety has entered our
mind, that we feel deserted by all hopefulness, and embittered by the
foul destiny reigning over man’s best efforts. There can be but little
doubt that the indifference, with which Kemény has been so far received
in Hungary, is largely owing to his pessimism. The Hungarians, like the
English, have little idiosyncrasy for pessimism. This mood of viewing
things is the outcome of mental struggles, from which the better minds of
both countries have been saved by their intense political life. Pessimism
is eminently the nursling of thought. In Hungary there is, as in England,
much more acting than thinking. Whatever there may be of pessimism in the
Hungarians is used up in some of their superbly-despondent folk-songs.
For Kemény’s pessimism the time has not yet come. Perhaps he would have
impressed his contemporaries far more deeply had he chosen not to write
historic novels. Nearly all of his great novels are historic novels.
As history, they are really incomparable. If we possessed a hundred
historic novels, describing a hundred important periods of general
history, in the manner, with the graphic power and true intimacy with the
past, so peculiar to Kemény, we should know history infinitely better.
Kemény has something of the erudition of a Gierke or John Selden, with
the plastic descriptiveness of a great painter. Read his Transylvanian
novels, and you have a clearer, more vivid and more correct knowledge
of Transylvanian history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
than you could gather from the study of the various chroniclers and
memoir-writers of that time, such as Reicherstorffer, Schesaeus,
Sigler, Heltai (see page 47), Verantius, Tinódy (see page 47), Somogyi
(Ambrosius), Stephen Szamosközy, Nicolas Oláh, Zsámboky, Michael Brutus,
Francis Forgách, Nicolas Istvánffy, Francis Mikó, Gregory Petthő, Kraus,
the Bethlens, Haner, etc. Kemény is thus one of the best historians of
Hungary. Nor can we think much less of him as a novelist. He engages our
interest in the characters of his tales; they work on our imagination,
they appeal to our hearts. More particularly to Hungarians, the actors of
Kemény’s novels appear as individuals full of charm and significance. To
use one of Ben Jonson’s happy phrases, they are “rammed with life”—life
national, patriotic, historic. And yet, with all these commanding
excellencies in his novels, Kemény has, there can be little doubt,
committed a grave blunder in literary strategy, in investing the output
of his vast intellectual mines in historic novels. Had he been less of a
historian, he might have written his historic novels at a smaller loss
of literary efficiency. His very greatness as a historian debarred him
from approaching Balzac still more closely. For his faithfulness as a
historian prevented him from elaborating fully those types of humanity,
the creation of which is Balzac’s glory. Such types cannot, as a rule, be
found in history. History, or that part of reality in which human beings
are the actors, is full of blurred types of mongreldom and bastardy. No
line in the features of man, as a real phenomenon, is drawn out purely
and to its legitimate term; good and bad, sublime and vile, sentiments
and deeds, are lumbering higgledy piggledy across each other. The poet
or artist, who is truest to reality, is untruest to poetry and art.
At all times the attempt at realism in art has landed where has the
attempt at materialism in philosophy—in impotence. Historic novels, if
very historic, as are these of Kemény, must thus necessarily benumb the
creative power of the poet. And so they have. Had Kemény, instead of
the past, embraced the present; had he followed in the wake of Balzac
in fetching from the depth of Hungarian humanity some of the arch-types
of European humanity, as was done by the author of “_Père Goriot_” with
regard to French humanity, Kemény would stand out as one of the greatest
writers of European literature. As it is, he is only one of the great
writers of Hungarian Literature. What is perhaps more astonishing still
in that choice of the historic novel by Kemény, is the fact that he was
for years engaged in a profession than which very few can attach us more
intently to actual, present life. Kemény was one of the most influential
and hardest-worked political journalists of his time. In the columns
of the “_Pesti Napló_” he poured out, in astounding profusion, leading
articles about all the great events and persons of his time. In these
articles he showed profound knowledge of the very pulse and heart of his
age; and such was his power of exposition, analysis and appreciation of
the fleeting occurrences of the day, that his political articles have
been a matter of admiration both to his contemporaries and subsequent
historians. As a rule, great politicians do not write historic novels.
They are too much imbued with the spirit of their own age, in the
direction of which they have had no small share, to be inclined, or even
able, to familiarise themselves with the spirit of ages bygone. Kemény is
an exception, and while this certainly testifies to the comprehensiveness
of his mind, it renders the strategic mistake above mentioned more marked
still.

We must abstain from giving a detailed account of his novels. Their plots
are, by themselves, simple, if not purely on the lines of the historic
events which they relate. Their author, like Balzac, excels chiefly in
psychology and analysis; and although the dialogue is not neglected, it
is not made the centre of the tale. In “_Gyulai Pál_” (1846) is shown the
struggle between a noble and high-minded statesman and his ambition. In
the attempt at saving his prince, Sigismund Báthori, from the latter’s
rival, Balthesar Báthori, Gyulai plunges into a series of crimes, and
mortally wounds the heart of his idol, Eleonore, who finally brings about
his execution. In “The Widow and Her Daughter” (“_Az özvegy és leánya_,”
1857) is told, and with greater regard to form and architecture than in
Kemény’s other novels, the tragedy of the family of Mikes. A subject
admirably suited to the gloom of Kemény’s mental atmosphere is treated
in his “The Fanatics” (“_A rajongók_,” 1859), a story of the curious
sect of the Sabbatarians in Transylvania in the fourth decade of the
seventeenth century (_cf._ page 55). The Macchiavellian prime minister,
Kassai, on the one hand, and the rich and mystic Simon Pécsi, the head
of the Sabbatarians, with his beautiful daughter Deborah, on the other,
are amongst the leading persons of this terrible novel. No less appalling
in its way is “Rough Times” (“_Zord idő_,” 1862), in which the capture
of the Hungarian capital, Buda, by the Turks, is told with magnificent
power. In the short novels of Kemény, taking up subjects of modern time
(“Love and Vanity” [“_Szerelem és hiúság_”]; “Husband and Wife” [“_Férj
és nő_”]; “The Abysses of the Heart” [“_A sziv örvényei_”]); as well
as in his smaller tales, such as “Virtue and Convention” (“_Erény és
illem_”); “Two Happy Persons” (“_Két boldog_”); “_Alhi Kmet_” (a proper
name), etc., Kemény likewise dwells on that _fatalisme raisonné_ as it
might be called, that does not permit him, or very rarely, to tarry over
the sunny moments of life. Writers like Kemény, in quite modern times,
have found means of gently veiling their inner despondency by light
touches of melancholy, as is done by Maeterlinck; or by fine irony, as
used by Anatole France. In Kemény there is no mercy, not even that of
irony. His novels are like the gigantic inundations of the Theiss river
in Hungary: you see the floods nearing, often noiselessly, but with
distressing rapidity, and in all directions; there is no escaping them;
in their inexorable progress they roll onward like a host of innumerable
serpents, stifling life and levelling down everything to the sameness
of death. When Kemény died (1875), on his small paternal estate of
Puszta-Kamarás, in Transylvania, he had himself long been buried by the
floods of mental derangement. Reality had shown him no pity either.




CHAPTER XXVII.


The poets and writers of the Magyars, whom we have been studying in the
preceding chapters, were, in a lesser or higher degree, authors of works
whose excellence was, to a large extent, of a relative, or national and
not of an absolute character.

We now approach the study of Alexander Petőfi. His was a genius which,
perhaps alone amongst Hungarian writers, so completely blended the
peculiar national excellencies of Magyar poetry with the broader features
of European literary greatness, as to entitle him to the admiration of
all who can feel poetic beauty, irrespective of nationality or even
language. Real poetry, like real music, appeals to all nations, and to
all times. In Petőfi there is real poetry. Other poets are felicitous
in expression, and the musical cadence of their diction endears them to
their compatriots. Others again create one or two poetical types the
charm of which lends grace and interest to even insignificant verses.
Many more poets again play on religious, moral, or patriotic sentiments,
and thus appeal to the hearts or imagination of readers with whom such
sentiments easily wax overwhelming. In Petőfi there is more than all
that. His language is rich and beautiful; yet it is not in his language
that he excels. He never or very seldom borrows effect from appeals to
morals or religion. He creates poetical phenomena—that is all. Where
before him nobody ever surmised any poetic phenomena at all, there he
conjures up a whole fairy-world of poetic conceptions, figures, events,
or scenes. The true poet discovers the new land by creating it. In Nature
herself there is no more poetry than in a grocer’s shop. Nor is there a
trace of any other thought in Nature. There is no philosophy in it and no
mathematics. Heaven alone knows how Nature is carrying on her business.
She is the most wasteful of managers, and yet she is never bankrupt. She
is as heedless as the most thoughtless of business men, and yet traces
of profound thought appear to be discoverable in her dealings. And so
the mathematician, or the physicist arrives at neatly limbed formulæ
expressing so-called laws of Nature. Yet nothing can be more certain
than that Nature herself is not acting on the lines of laws. To us, to
human beings, it appears convenient and useful to bracket some of the
happenings of infinite Nature between logical ideas, thereby giving us
the satisfaction of “understanding” those happenings. Nature abhors being
understood, yet by dint of an irrepressible desire of man, thinkers will
always attempt at construing her by dressing up natural phenomena in the
jackets of formulæ and in the petticoats of concepts.

It is even so with poetry. There is no poetry whatever in Nature. All
poetry is invented and created by man, just as all music is. He who
invents the greatest number of events, scenes, or types that strike
men as being poetical, is the greatest of poets. It is impossible to
say how he invents them; nor can he or anybody else say where, that
is, with relation to what spot, creature, or phenomenon of Nature he
will invent them. One thing alone is certain, he must _invent_ them.
For centuries before Petőfi was born, Hungary had had the same mixed
population; the same mountains; the same mighty rivers and lakes; and
the same mysterious _puszta_, which to Petőfi suggested an astounding
number of exquisite poems. He alone “understood their mystic language;”
that is, he alone invented the poetry to the substratum of Nature; he
alone wrote the thrilling drama to the dumb flies and staging of Nature
in Hungary. He sees an old ram-shackle inn in the midst of the _puszta_.
To the ordinary mortal the inn is suggestive of nothing more than the
expectation of a poor dinner, of a bad bedstead, of uncanny companions.
To an ordinary poet it may suggest images of decay or regret, more or
less poetical. To Petőfi it suggests intensely poetical scenes of life
exuberant or decadent; the inn (“_csárda_”) is transfigured by him into
a living being; every one of its corners commences to breathe poetry,
music, reminiscences and forebodings. So new and individual a creation
is thus made of that wayside inn, that the painter may find in it new
subjects for his canvas, and the musician new themes for his lyre.
Wherever Petőfi is touched by nature or society, he responds by the
creation of poetic phenomena. The wind blowing over the plains of Hungary
is, in truth, inarticulate; in wafting through the body and soul of the
incomparable poet it turns, as if directed through the pipes of an organ
at the hands of a Bach, to melancholy fugues and majestic oratorios.
And so with everything. Petőfi sings love in hundreds of poems, yet he
was scarcely ever loved by woman. For nearer as woman is to Nature, she
is also more realistic and less charged with poetry than man. What then
could she do with one who had unloaded into the chests of his youthful
soul all the treasures of poetry, but none of gold? This, however, far
from deterring Petőfi or disgusting him, rather stimulated him. He loved
much; that is, he loved little. Love was for him, like the _puszta_, the
Theiss river and the Carpathian mountains, an immense suggestiveness;
an ocean, the crossing of which led to the discovery of new continents
of poetry. Nearly all the pretty or interesting women whom he met,
whether the lawless gipsy-girl, the actress, the coy _bourgeoise_,
the lady, the peasant-girl or the hostelry-maid, he loved them all or
thought he did. And this was owing not to his extreme youth—he died when
six-and-twenty—but to his passion for poetic creativeness. Everyone
of the types of women just mentioned served him as an occasion for
creating one of those scenes as replete with life poetic as are forests
or rivers with life natural. In one sense indeed he was right in saying
that he was “the wild flower of boundless Nature” (“_A korláttalan
természet-Vadvirága vagyok én_”). His mode of creation was quite on the
lines of that of Nature. A poem grew out of his mind as does a violet
out of the ground. In him there is no reflection, no machinery, no
hesitation. Every line rolls on with the assurance and self-contentedness
of a rose-leaf budding forth from the stem. He has the meditated
carelessness of Nature, and also her freshness, her immediateness and
spontaneity. More particularly, he is like Nature in Hungary. From the
heights of thought as lofty as the peaks of the Carpathian mountains,
and as chilling as those snow-clad solitudes (see his superb philosophic
flashes in the poems written at Szalk Szt Márton, in 1846), he descends
into the tiny nest of homely sentiments as does a lark into the furrow.
His indignation, patriotic or otherwise, is as terrible as are the
inundations of the Theiss; and side by side with poems flaming with
uncontrollable fire and restlessness are poems full of oriental calm
and staid repose. Yet, in the poet’s own opinion, he resembled most
the _puszta_ or immense plain of Hungary. Petőfi, who had tramped over
nearly every part of his country, gave, in a magnificent poem, the palm
of beauty to the steppes and pampas of central and southern Hungary.
The _puszta_ in Hungary is really a series of some three thousand
_pusztas_, of which the most famous is that of Hortobágy, near Debreczen,
the praises of which Petőfi has sung in various exquisite poems. These
_pusztas_ differ very much in physical character; some are covered with
rich wheat-fields, tobacco plantations, or maize-forests; others again
are swamps, or natron-ponds, or again waste lands, or heaths. This
diversity of abundance and penury, ecstasy of nature and dreary desert,
squares well with the rhapsodic temper of the Magyars in general, and
that of Petőfi in particular. After miles and miles of deadly silence,
the traveller enters one of the bustling “market-towns,” full of the
eccentric and picturesque types of the _puszta_. There is the dignified
farmer or peasant, with his smart, coquettish, and light-tongued wife,
or _mennyecske_ (“little heaven”); there are the various shepherds and
keepers of sheep (“_bojtár_”), oxen (“_gulyás_”), swine (“_kondás_”), or
horses (“_csikós_”), each in his particular costume and each a different
type of the Hungarian Bedouin. The “_bojtár_,” tending the immense herds
of sheep and lambs in the pampas, is mild-tempered, musical and full
of secret medical lore. The animals under his care are frequently ill,
and he watches their instinctive ways of picking out the herbs that
will cure them. So he acquires a knowledge of herbs and an insight into
nature which makes him appear a wizard. The “_gulyás_” tends the big
cattle, oxen and bulls, and is naturally a rough fellow, fond of fight
and of wild rollicking. He frequently wrestles with enraged bulls that
have fled into the swamps, or with the poachers and robbers roaming
over the _puszta_. The “_kondás_” is the lowest type of those herdsmen.
He is sullen, hard of access, and irascible, and easily turns into a
robber. The most brilliant type is the “_csikós_.” He tends the immense
herds of horses browsing in the prairies of Hungary. As the violin and
the _furulya_ (or sort of piccolo) are the national instruments of the
Magyars, so the horse is their national animal. “The Magyar is created
for being on horseback” (_lóra termett a magyar_), the Hungarian proverb
holds. Peasant or nobleman, all are keen horsemen, and so intense is
their love of the horse that, like Arabs, Hungarian poets treat the horse
as a poetical character. The _csikós_ is dashing, quick at repartee,
an excellent dancer and singer or rather improvisatore, and grown to
his horse. He knows every patch of his _puszta_, and every trick and
dodge of horse-dealing and—horse-stealing. The girls idolize him. In
his fluttering, highly-coloured costume, he is the very martial, bold
and provoking youth whom girls will worship. Amidst these types of the
_puszta_, none the least fascinating is the “_szegény legény_,” or “poor
lad.” He is the robber and brigand of the _puszta_, and the romantic
interest attaching to him grows out of the belief that he took to his
lawless profession after having been thwarted in life or baffled in
love. But of all the phenomena of the _puszta_, the Fata Morgana, or
_mirage_, in Hungarian “_déli báb_,” is the most striking. On a sultry
afternoon in summer, cities appear in mid-heaven, images of towers
and castles, immense lakes and forests. They shine sometimes with a
peculiar, supermundane lustre, and the traveller thinks he is walking in
fairy-land. Then suddenly they disappear. Such is the _puszta_.

The influence of the _puszta_ on the Magyar poets is undeniable; and
Petőfi, more than any other Hungarian poet, seems to be the high-priest
and devotee of the peculiar charms of the great plain. The real relation,
however, between the poet and his country is that between the traveller
and the mirage. It is in the eyes of the former that the latter is
forming, and there alone. Petőfi creates the Fata Morgana, with which he
fills the vast horizon of his beloved _puszta_. Although professionally
a lyric poet, his lyrics are of the purely objective kind. Many of his
best poems might be told in prose, and in any other language, without
losing much of their charm. There is, in his best works, an abiding
_fond_ of poetry, quite independent of the music or picturesqueness
of his words, or the strikingness of his similes. Heine, in his best
moments, rivals without always equalling him. Petőfi’s poems are mostly
very short; they, as it were, only state the poetic scene which then
works on the imagination or heart of the reader quite alone. When Heine
speaks of the lonely pine-tree standing on the snow-covered heights of
the north, dreaming of a palm perched in the far east on a rock burning
with the heat of the sun of the desert, he strikes a chord that will
vibrate in us long after and beyond the two simple stanzas in which
he tells the story of the two trees. This is objective poetry. It is
in this that Petőfi excels. Already in some of his earliest poems he
writes perfect objective poetry. In “The Stolen Horse” (“_Lopott ló_,”
1843) we are told of one of those fleeting scenes in puszta-life, in
which the poet by seizing the pregnant point where present, past and
future meet, gives us the story of several lives in words so few as to
seem insufficient for the telling even of a short anecdote. A _csikós_
dashes on a stolen horse over the vast plain. The rich owner of the
noble animal, happening to pass by, recognizes his property, and calls
upon the _csikós_ to stop and surrender the horse. The fellow takes no
heed, and storms onward. Suddenly he stops, and turning round to the
owner, he exclaims, “Don’t miss your horse too badly; you have so many
of them. One heart was in my breast, and alas! your daughter has wrecked
it;” and disappears in the desert. The story of the poor boy’s love for
the haughty daughter of the rich man, her cruelty, the father’s pride,
the boy’s vengeance, his entrance on the wild life of a “poor lad,” or
robber; all that is pictured and suggested in the few words. In another
poem, the first line of which is “The wife of the inn-keeper loved
the vagabond” (“_A csaplárosné a betyárt szerette_,” 1844), the whole
tragedy of true love thwarted by lawless love is told in a few lines.
The vagabond (“_betyár_,” really “robber”) loves the maid of the wife
of an inn-keeper in the _puszta_. The wife loves the robber, and being
cut by him, drives away the poor girl, who dies of cold in the _puszta_.
The robber thereupon kills the woman, and dies on the gallows, without
regret, for “his life was no longer worth to him a pipe of tobacco.”
Another poem describes the wild rollicking of the boys in the village inn
at night. A knock is heard at the window, and a harsh voice bids the boys
to stop lest the quiet of the squire be disturbed. The boys only hold
forth all the louder. Another knock at the window is heard. In mild tones
a man asks the fellows to stop yelling, for his poor mother is ill. At
once all the frolic is at an end, and the boys leave the inn. It is in
such scenes, all expressed in the simplest and yet idiomatic language,
that Petőfi’s genius shines forth. Of him indeed it may be said that no
colour, tint or instrument with which to touch and stir up the human
heart was alien to him. Considering his extreme youth and the intense
gravity of his pathos, his exquisite and genuine humour is nothing short
of marvellous. It is the humour of a mature mind, full of ripe suavity
and mellow joyousness. Of Petőfi’s humour we could not use Hood’s lines:

    “There’s not a string attuned to mirth
    But has its chord in melancholy.”

It is playful humour, laughing a broad, sound laugh. He is not as witty
as Heine or Byron, but neither is he as cutting. In his famous poem
ridiculing the Magyar _hidalgo_ (“_A magyar nemes_”) there is nothing but
broad thrusts of a well-handled sword. There is no pricking with needles,
nor any guffaws of a satyr.

Literary critics in Hungary and elsewhere have, in their anxiety for
classification and cataloguing, placed Petőfi amongst the so-called
folk-poets, and nothing is more frequent than a comparison of Petőfi
with Burns and Béranger, the _chansonniers_ of Scotland and France
respectively. However, the comparison is untenable. While humour, pathos,
tenderness and descriptive powers will readily be accorded, and in great
measure, to the Scotch singer, he can hardly be compared to Petőfi in
that distinctively creative power, which not only touches sentiment, not
only finds charming words and images for things external or internal,
but also and chiefly discovers new poetic continents, so to speak, new
mines of poetic gold. The very range of subjects covered by the poetry of
the Hungarian poet is considerably wider than that of the Scotch bard;
and in the last two years of his life Petőfi was raised, partly by his
own genius and partly by the events of his time, to the position of a
nation’s prophet. This very position acted on his poetic gifts with a
force that Burns never experienced, and accordingly, every comparison of
the two poets is radically false. The same remark applies to Béranger.
The entire atmosphere of his famous _chansons_ is so different from that
of Petőfi’s songs, as to render a comparison of the two impossible.
Béranger sings the glories of the great Revolution and of Napoleon’s
time. He is sweet, fresh, graceful, full of _élan_ and smartness. He
creates a _genre_, a mode of poetry, but a limited one. Petőfi was
impressed by both poets; he knew Burns and Béranger well, and studied
them, together with Shelley, Byron, and Heine, pretty carefully. But
he never imitated them, and for the simple reason that he could not do
so. He was in the best sense of the word, original, that is, creative.
He could imitate no one, and no one could imitate him. Petőfi cannot be
classified; he is a class by himself. He cultivates, it is true, the
manner and tone of the folk-song (“_népdal_”), and so to superficial
critics he may appear only as the best folk-song writer of Hungary. He
is infinitely more than that; in 1846, for instance, he did not write a
single “_népdal_” (folk-song); he is Hungary’s greatest poet. In him is
embodied the entire poetical genius of a nation, in whose single members
we may frequently find the gift of improvisation and poetic invention.
The rhapsodic vein so conspicuous in the everyday life of Hungary, and
the exaggerations of which have vitiated many an effort, literary or
musical, comes out in Petőfi in its full vigour and full beauty. Like
all great poets, he is intensely truthful. There is no sham whatever in
him, no affectation and no false note. His passion is terribly real, and
his mirth, true joy. Nowhere can this absolute truthfulness be noticed
with greater clearness; nowhere does it shine forth more imposingly
than in one of Petőfi’s wildest, and apparently most exaggerated poems,
“The Madman” (“_Az őrült_”). It is a monologue of a mad Titan, whose
fine intellect has been unhinged by ingratitude of friends, treachery
of women, and undeserved reverses. We do not hesitate to say that there
is in the whole range of European literature no other single poem
representing the demoniac charm of a mind at once vigorous and diseased
with equal force and truth. Constantly moving on the edges of abysses
than which the human mind or heart does not know any more appalling, the
“madman” yet talks with a power and lucidity so overwhelming as to send
through his hearers the holy shivers of religious prostration. Distorted
in form, terribly true in substance; such is the character of this unique
poem, in which all the serpents of scorn and pain seem to wriggle
beneath the leaves of the beautiful word-foliage.

From Petőfi emanates the very soul of poetry and of all art: enthusiasm,
inspiration. After having written comic epics, love-poems, and
genre-pictures with a success never before witnessed, Petőfi, on the
approach of the revolutionary period, wrote those inflammatory patriotic
songs, the power of which was officially recognized by the Hungarian
Government, who had enormous numbers of Petőfi’s patriotic poetry printed
at their expense and distributed among the soldiers of the revolutionary
armies. His poems were then a national event, and they may in justice be
compared to a series of different “_Marseillaises_.”

We began our characterization of Petőfi by saying that he, perhaps alone
amongst Hungarian writers, completely blended Hungarian with European
elements. We may now state the reason of this his peculiar excellence.
Petőfi, like all classical poets, while very great as a master of
form, owes less to the beauty or ornaments of his language than to the
objective beauty of his imagery, personifications and poetic scenes.
For such as largely identify literature with great word-feats, Virgil
will be greater than Homer (as was commonly believed in the seventeenth
century); Tennyson greater than Shelley; Platen greater than Heine; and
Arany (see page 194) greater than Petőfi. This is, however, not the
judgment of such as gauge poetic greatness by the measure of objective
beauty contained in a given work. The importance of form in poetry can
hardly be exaggerated, and the necessity of paying the closest attention
to the rules of form will be felt by no one more keenly than by the
student of Hungarian Literature. Yet in attempting to find a measure
of comparison between great poets, who all more or less excel in form,
there can be no doubt, that he who is richer in objective beauty is also
the superior poet. It is this superiority that raises Petőfi head and
shoulders not only over the rest of the Hungarian poets, but also above
most other poetic writers of modern Europe. The types of the _puszta_,
which we have essayed to sketch above, the women, and events of his time;
all these and many more Magyar subjects were by Petőfi so _objectivated_,
and given an independent poetic existence of their own, that they cease
to be familiar to Hungarians only. They grow on the German, French or
English reader with equal sympathy, and Petőfi thus needs less commentary
for the foreigner than any other Hungarian poet. His works are like
the Hungarian Rhapsodies of Liszt, which appeal to Americans with the
same irresistible force as to Magyars, as the present writer has had
abundant opportunity of experiencing in the United States. Yet the same
Magyar melodies and turbulent cadences that Liszt, and Liszt alone,
succeeded in _objectivating_, utterly fail of effect in countries other
than Hungary when played by Hungarian gypsies in unadulterated Magyar
fashion. This, then, is the deepest and truest secret of Petőfi’s immense
power: while embracing mostly Magyar subjects, he so _objectivates_ them
as to render them enjoyable and sympathetic to non-Magyar readers too.
National poets inferior to Petőfi give their nation songs which other
nations too possess, and the only difference between them is that of
language. Petőfi gave Hungary and the rest of the civilized world what
no nation other than the Hungarian possesses. As the Hungarian nation
itself has an individuality so marked and so different from the other
nations of Europe, as to entail upon it an historic and social vocation
_sui generis_, so the poems of Petőfi, as the most felicitous exponent
of Hungarian nationality, add to the types of poetry produced by other
nations, a type, a species so individual and so richly personal as to
endow it with a literary vocation altogether its own. If we are to reduce
this peculiarly Magyar element to the precincts of a word, we should say
it is the rhapsodic element. By this we mean a peculiar temper of the
inspired mind pervading its joyous, humorous, meditative or despondent
moods alike. As Liszt is the greatest exponent of this rhapsodic
element in music, so Petőfi is in poetry. Most other rhapsodic poets or
musicians, Magyar or otherwise, have badly failed, some by degenerating
into rant or redundancy, others by becoming formless. Petőfi alone
succeeded in raising rhapsodies to the level of true art.

It was said above that Petőfi’s works are not in need of much commentary,
even for the foreigner. We may now add that the only commentary needed is
a knowledge of Petőfi’s life. Petőfi’s short life as a poet was coeval
with the great awakening of the Magyar nation to the full consciousness
of its position and its rights. He was born in 1823, in Kis-Körös,
and was the son of a well-to-do butcher, by the name of Petrovics,
husband to a Slav woman, called Mary Hruz. For historians who believe
in the race-theory, there is ample room for speculation, sympathetic or
malevolent, in the fact that the beloved mother of Hungary’s greatest
Magyar poet belonged to the “race” of the Slavs, whom all staunch Magyars
are disinclined to reckon amongst human beings. “_Tót nem ember, kása nem
étel_” (“The Slav is no human being, and porridge is no meal”), holds
the Hungarian proverb. Fully convinced as we are that there is no truth
whatever in the race-theory, we can only see in the fact of Petőfi being
the child of a Slav mother and a Magyar (or Magyar-speaking) father
a providential fact creating Hungary’s greatest poet from amongst a
_milieu_ saturated with both of the main elements of Hungarian society:
Magyar and Slav. Young Petőfi spent his youth in the large plains between
the Theiss and the Danube, and the impressions of that picturesque
portion of Hungary have left their indelible traces on his imagination.
At the age of fifteen, Petőfi was deprived of the comfort he had so far
enjoyed, by the financial failure of his father. From that time onward
he led a life replete with hardships of all kinds. At school he was a
failure, and even in poetics, as he has told us in one of his humorous
poems, he was “ploughed.” Being somewhat too fond of the inspiration of
the wine-cup, or at least being credited with such fondness, he soon
fell out with his hosts, his teachers and finally with his father. From
the misery of his position he tried to save himself by volunteering as a
private in the Austrian army. The very harsh treatment he had to endure
as a soldier told on his health, and although he had still moral strength
left to scribble his poems on the planks of the sentry-box in which he
mounted guard during the bitter winter, he at last was dismissed from
the service on account of symptoms of consumption. In the following two
or three years we find him tramping over all Hungary, writing verse,
and eking out a miserable livelihood by means of acting on provincial
stages. The great poet long believed in his vocation as an actor, and
obstinately stuck to a determination that met nowhere with any serious
encouragement. Meanwhile, however, his verses had made him a well-known
poet, and soon the idol of the country. In his travels to the north of
Hungary he was received, more especially at Kassa and Eperjes, with
honours usually accorded only to royalty. The nation felt that he was the
living personification of all the political and poetical aspirations of
the Magyars then struggling for manifestation. In 1846 he made, in the
county of Szathmár, the acquaintance of that strange and ill-balanced
girl, who was to become his wife. Juliet Szendrey was her name. She was
the daughter of a steward on one of the great estates of a Hungarian
nobleman, and had from early years shown symptoms of that malady which is
now more widely known under the name of “new womanism,” or “_féminisme_.”
Accordingly, she was eccentric and aimless, and when Petőfi made love to
her she was at a loss how to respond to a feeling so simple and natural.
Having given Petőfi some cruel samples of the waywardness of her temper,
it occurred to her that she might inflict even more pain on her father by
marrying the poor poet, and consequently she did so against the wish of
her parent. The young couple lived in very primitive lodgings in Pest,
and Madame took her fame as the wife of a great man with very grand
airs. She so intensely appreciated the happiness of being wedded to a
young genius and an affectionate husband, that she married, not quite
a year after Petőfi’s disappearance on the battlefield of Segesvár, a
man in every way infinitely inferior to Petőfi. Can anything prove the
Fata Morgana character of poetry and of poets more cruelly than the ever
infamous conduct of that highly cultivated woman, who, after having been
idolized and, in verses, immortalized by one of the greatest of poets,
showed her worthlessness by marrying a mediocrity before a single year
had elapsed after the glorious death of her husband, whose infant son
still required all her care? But let us return to the poet. A few months
after his marriage Petőfi began his political career by announcing to
the people of Pest the abolition of the censorship, and by reading to
the enthusiastic crowd his famous poem, “Rise o’ Magyar” (“_Talpra
magyar!_”), on the Ides of March, 1848. Towards the end of the same
year he took service in the revolutionary army, and was attached to
the Polish general, Bem, a hero wounded in untold battles for liberty,
and then serving the cause of the Magyars in Transylvania. Few letters
are more touching than the letters written by Petőfi in fair French to
the old warrior, his “father,” as he calls him. Bem, himself a genius
of character, at once felt and recognized the genius of Petőfi, and
with great tact smoothed over difficulties arising from the poet’s wild
insubordination. Against the advice and in spite of the entreaties of
numerous friends, who wanted to save the poet for his country, Petőfi
took actual part in various battles. He was last heard of in the battle
of Segesvár, in Transylvania, on July 31st, 1849, where he died as he had
long wished, fighting for his country. “To live for love, and die for
one’s country”—he had not only sung it....

The works of Petőfi are both lyrical and epical; his novelistic attempts,
“The Rope of the Hangman” (“_A hóhér kötele_”) are crude, so are his few
essays in the drama. Amongst his epics, “_Childe John_” (“_János vitéz_”)
is the best. It is a comic epic, or rather a fairy-story told with
exquisite humour and exuberance of fancy. Another excellent comic epic of
his is “_Bolond İstók_.” His lyrical poems are very numerous and cover,
as has been already indicated, the whole range of human sentiment.
Perhaps it is not superfluous to remark that there is in all the works
of Petőfi not a word likely to jar on the ear of the most fastidious
moralist. Like himself, his works all breathe the purity and health of
untainted youth.

The reader will now perhaps expect a laborious statement of the
shortcomings and failings of Petőfi as a poet. And many a Hungarian
critic has, apart from his professional duty to fall foul of this or
that feature in the literary physiognomy of poets, pointed out some
grievous drawbacks in Petőfi’s works. Thus, most critics have, while
lauding the splendid lyrical subjectivity of Petőfi, pointed out his
alleged incapacity to write anything else than himself. His chief
deficiency, it has been asserted, is his lack of objective imagination,
such as was possessed by the great epic and dramatic writers of European
literature. To this the answer is, it appears to us, very simple.
Petőfi never wrote a work intended to be an epic proper; nor were his
attempts at dramatic composition really serious. He cannot, therefore,
be legitimately reproached with having failed where he did not intend to
succeed. He never deliberately worked for such achievements of objective
imagination as show in the creation of dramatic personalities. Yet most
of his perfect poems manifest, as we have tried to show above, that
very objective imagination in the rarest form of strength. Hungarian
literary criticism is still, we regret to say, in a stage of development
considerably lower than Hungarian literary composition. Hence such
judgments on Petőfi. Can we pronounce otherwise on the literary critics
of Hungary, who have so far produced no single comprehensive study on the
works of a poet who is at once their greatest and most famous genius?
Genius has this peculiarity that its works are easy to enjoy but hard
to criticise. In reality, it takes another genius, a critical one, to
appreciate it adequately. In this respect, foreign literary criticism has
been relatively more just to Petőfi. In all the countries of Europe and
America, Petőfi’s name has been steadily spreading, and numerous attempts
at translations of his works have been made in both hemispheres. We do
not think that Petőfi is untranslatable. His very objectiveness renders
him more fit for free and yet faithful translations than, for instance,
Arany (see page 194). Another reason is that Petőfi lays less stress on
form and metre than other poets of an equal rank. He who fully seizes
the beauty of the poetic subject-matter in Petőfi’s poems can render
them more or less adequately in any language. More, however, than by
translation might be achieved by Hungarian artists who by picturing the
paintable features of Petőfi’s poems, would contribute most potently
to a general appreciation of his genius. There are hundreds of perfect
pictures to be taken from his works, provided the painter takes them from
him in the way in which Petőfi took them from nature.




CHAPTER XXVIII.


Outside Hungary, the name of John Arany is seldom heard; and western
readers will be astonished to hear that Arany is considered by many
of the best known Magyar critics the greatest of the Hungarian poets.
Petőfi has never quite pleased the professors of æsthetics and poetry
in the various universities and “_academies_” of Hungary; and there
being no Magyar Saint Beuves or August Schlegels, to guide, with tact
sustained by learning, and learning eased by tact, the tastes and
literary opinions of the professorial minds in Hungary, it is not rare
to hear and read of Arany as the greatest poetic genius of the Magyars.
We hasten to add, that we readily bow to the greatness and charm, and
still more to the merits of Arany. He is a great poet indeed. Nearly
every one of his numerous ballads, epics and smaller poems is replete
with the glamour of true poetry. In point of language he is, no doubt,
the most idiomatic and richest of all Hungarian writers. Yet, with all
these gifts and excellencies, he is not equal to Petőfi. Reaching, as he
did, an age nearly three times as protracted as that of Petőfi, he could
yet not, through any stretch of time or effort, attain to powers which
have been bestowed upon very few poets. Petőfi ranks with the world’s
greatest poets; Arany ranks only with the great poets of Hungary. To the
strictly Magyar Jingo, as well as to the Magyar professor, Arany may
appear greater even than Petőfi; we hope to show that his genius is of a
nature at once different from and smaller than that of the incomparable
Alexander.

The reader will, we trust, permit us to premise a short remark which,
especially for English readers, seems indispensable for a right
appreciation of Arany. In England there has long ceased to be a peasantry
proper; at any rate, there has for now over 400 years been no such
peasantry in England, as may still be seen on the continent generally,
and in Hungary in particular. The type “peasant” is at once the
arch-type of narrow-mindedness, sordidness, _naïveté_, and spontaneous
poetry. He is conservative in the extreme and slow, yet frequently the
source of great upheavals and revolutions. His speech is concrete and
“_terre-à-terre_,” yet at the same time full of quaint metaphors and
conceits. His thoughts are all on the line of synthesis; and analysis
is as strange to him as generalization. He loves Nature; but he is too
much at one with it, part of it, to feel poetically the gulf between
Nature and Man. Honour and respect for himself and his ancient customs
are as the life-atmosphere of his existence; and thus in the social
architecture of the continental state to him is allotted the staying
force of the pillars, beams and rafters of the building.[3] This, the
general picture of the continental peasant, has to be touched up here and
there when meant to represent the Hungarian peasant proper. For, luckily
for Hungarian poets, the Magyar peasant, while fully as conservative
and old-fashioned as his Austrian or German brother, is considerably
less sordid, more frank, and altogether more “gentlemanly.” Yet he is
a peasant, a part both of Hungary’s civic and natural complexion. Now
it is this Hungarian peasant, and his social complement, the rural
nobleman, who are the centre of Arany’s poetry. We say “complement,” for
it is at present well understood by all close students of continental
nobility, that the latter is, in essence and sociological drift, if
not in appearance, one and the same phenomenon as the peasantry. Both
classes form the conservative or static forces of continental states,
and both are necessary conditions for the existence of a _bourgeois_
proper. Without them, or without one of them, the medium or _bourgeois_
element is altogether wanting, or, as in England, of a complexion
totally at variance with the continental middle class. Now in Hungary,
and more especially still, in the Hungary of Arany’s youth and first
manhood (1840-1870), there was no numerous _bourgeois_ proper; and Arany,
singing in tones and images flowing from and meant for the two other
classes only, is for that very reason _toto coelo_ different from most
of the German and French and also from English poets. Modern western
literature, in Austria and Germany exclusively; in France almost, and in
England largely so, is _bourgeois_ poetry; poetry written by and for the
middle and central classes of the community; or at any rate expressive
of sentiments and mental states growing in the atmosphere of _bourgeois_
life. The poems of Arany, on the other hand, were growing in the fields
and farms of the peasant, and in the manors of the landed nobility; even
more in the former than in the latter. Theirs is a spirit charming in
its rural breeziness and compact humour; fascinating in its _naïveté_
and coyness; but somewhat out of tune with the modern or _bourgeois_
sentiment. The more the middle or _bourgeois_ class develops in Hungary,
the less the fame of Arany will continue unimpaired. His works will be
unable to satisfy the poetic needs of a class which he did not know, and
with which he had but scant sympathy. His very _naïveté_, his greatest
poetic charm, will be found wanting. _Naïveté_, like all other tempers
of the heart or mind, has its geography, its _locus_. It does not grow
anywhere or everywhere. It requires a peculiar borderland situated where
two social classes meet. In that borderland it grows willingly. Such
lands are of course to be found only where classes do meet socially. In
England, for instance, classes carefully avoid meeting intimately in a
social manner; although they do so frequently in a manner political,
commercial and religious. Hence, _naïveté_ is scarcely to be found,
either in English life or in English poetry. By a parity of reasoning,
American poetry, based on a life with practically no classes whatever,
can boast still fewer of the blossoms of naïve types or naïve style.
Arany’s world, it is true, is one where the two classes, the nobleman
and the peasant, do meet intimately, and thus the flowers of _naïveté_
are plentiful. It is a _naïveté_ shy of display and timid; a _naïveté_
in deeds more than in words; and finally, a _naïveté_ of men rather
than of women. It has, when enjoyed in Arany’s own exquisite Magyar, a
flavour so pure and hearty, so thoroughly true and poetic as to endear
everything it touches. Yet it is the _naïveté_ of the peasant, not of the
_bourgeois_. It is poor in types, and restricted in emotions. It does
not respond to the psychical atmosphere of the ever growing _bourgeois_
class in Hungary, and accordingly the numerous readers of that class look
for their reading somewhere else. The peasant and the rural nobleman
are both captivating types for poets; they do not, however, represent
more than a minor aspect of that broad humanity which has so far found
its noblest expression in tales, dramas and poems grafted on events or
sentiments of individuals outside the clans and septs of peasants and
noblemen. The Germans, who have the excellent term of “_bürgerliches
Drama_” (_bourgeois_ drama), have felt that profound change coming over
western literature very keenly; and the greatness of their literature is
owing to that circumstance in no small degree. As in Hungary, nearly all
great writers were, first magnates, and then noblemen (even Petőfi was a
nobleman, although he set no value on that fact), so in Germany all the
great writers have been without an exception, “_Bürger_” (_bourgeois_)
proper. Now it is the peculiar greatness of Petőfi that many of his
poems appeal to the sentiments and mental attitudes of that specifically
modern public, the _bourgeois_ readers, with a force and sympathy as
strong as is the charm of many others to the “common people” or peasants
of Hungary. It is said of Pico de Mirandola that while he excited the
awe and admiration of the most learned and thoughtful men at the end of
the fifteenth century Rome and Florence, the maidens and young men of
the beautiful city on the Arno were singing with delight his exquisite
love-songs. Such is Petőfi; such is not Arany. He cannot properly be
enjoyed except in his own Magyar, and by readers intimately acquainted
with the two classes he belongs to. Not even when he selects, as he
sometimes does, foreign subjects, as in his “_The Bards of Wales_,” does
he become less “clannish.” Of the strongest of all feelings of young
humanity, of Love, he has none but epic expression; he never wrote a
love-song proper. The women in his epics are mere phantasms, angels or
fiends; and his men are peasants or heroes, or both. The point on which
he excels every other Hungarian poet, and on which will repose his
lasting fame, is his language. It has the raciness of the peasant’s
talk with the moderation of refined style. In other countries writers
introduced new elements of poetic speech by means of using words or
phrases taken or imitated from one of the dialects of their province or
county. Even in Shakespeare there are traces of the then Warwickshire
dialect, and probably still more of Warwickshire folk-lore. German
writers have legitimated innumerable provincialisms. Hungarian, on the
other hand, has no dialects, or none to speak of. The writer who wants
to find new linguistic affluents can turn only to the stock used by the
peasants in the vast plain of Hungary. Arany, replete as he was with all
the wealth of the language used by the peasants, knew how to ennoble
and purify the language of the farmers and shepherds of the _puszta_,
and to impart to it much of that Greek simplicity and beauty of which,
as a scholar, he was so competent a student. As the French language is
not rich in words but in idioms, so Hungarian is not rich in words but
in word-formations. Especially the verb admits of a variety of forms
and terminations enveloping every shade of thought or movement with the
glibness of water. It is in such linguistic feats that Arany shows his
genius; and since language in Hungary has an importance tenfold more
significant than in countries composed of less polyglot peoples, it is
quite natural that in the literary appreciation of Arany at the hands
of Magyar critics the political element has played a very considerable
part. This is, as we stated above, his great merit. Language in all
modern countries has at first been the make of the peasant classes. In
them there is that mysterious and instinctive power which has produced
the splendid series of Romance and Teutonic languages which, by literary
craft, have come to be formed into the diction of Dante, Cervantes,
Molière, Shakespeare, and Goethe. Arany, in focussing this power with the
strength of a mind at once _logopoeic_ and richly stored with knowledge,
did an inestimable service to the cause of Magyar Literature and Magyar
Nationality. In that respect he occupies in Hungarian Literature a place
undoubtedly higher than that of any other Magyar writer. In matter, he
could not fully unite the strictly Magyar with the broader European
element; in poetic language, on the other hand, he did achieve that
union; and it is in that achievement of his that we must look for his
specific genius and merit.

Unlike as was Arany’s personality to that of Petőfi: the former modest
and retiring, the latter self-assertive and dashing; their careers too
were equally different from each other. Arany’s life (1817-Oct. 22nd,
1882), was one of quiet work first as a teacher, and later on (1860),
as president of the Kisfaludy Society, and since 1864, as Secretary of
the Academy of Science. The latter part of his life was distressed by
persistent ill-health. In character Arany belonged to the select few,
who have never stooped to any baseness whatever and never lost sight
of the ideals of their youth. He was the intimate friend of Petőfi,
who at once recognized his greatness, and the tolerant patron of the
younger generation of writers. The nation mourned his death as a national
calamity.

Arany is, almost exclusively, a poet of epic songs, epics proper and
ballads. Of the former his most finished works are the Toldi Trilogy,
consisting of “_Toldi_” (the name of the hero, published in 1847);
“_Toldi szerelme_” (“The love of Toldi,” published in 1879); and “_Toldi
estéje_” (“The eve of Toldi,” published previously in 1854). These three
epics, written in rhymed six-feet stanzas of eight lines each, tell the
life-story of an historic Magyar peasant-hero of the fourteenth century,
in the times of King Lewis, justly called the “Great.” He is of herculean
strength, of violent temper, but good-hearted, simple, a loving son, and
a loyal friend and subject. His struggle against his wicked brother; his
love for Piroska, whom, in a passage at arms, he foolishly wins for
another wooer; his despair at seeing the idol of his heart the wife of
another; finally, his declining years when he finds himself out of accord
with the changed times, and retires home to be put into the grave he had
dug for himself. Such is, in the main, the contents of the three epics,
into which the wizard language of Arany has infused the charms of real
poetry. It would be idle to compare Arany’s art with that of Goethe’s
“_Hermann und Dorothea_.” Goethe’s hero too is rather a peasant farmer
than a _bourgeois_. Yet all the other figures of Goethe’s masterpiece are
endowed with life so intensely _bourgeois_, as to secure admiration for
the work in all times to come. Arany’s hero; his dear old mother; his
brother; his love, etc., scarcely leave the boundaries of peasant-world;
and while his epic will thus for ever charm the youth of Hungary, it may
in future cease to be an object of lasting admiration on the part of the
more mature classes of the nation.

The same great qualities of linguistic _verve_ and intense poetic
sentiment are to be found in the other epical poems of Arany. In the
“Death of Buda” (_Buda halála_, 1864), he sings the legendary story
of Attila’s murder of his own brother Buda (Bleda). In this exquisite
epic Attila (or Etele, as Arany calls him), is pictured as a hero of
the magnificent type, and nothing could be more removed from the poet’s
“Etele,” than the conventional or historic Attila. Tragical energy and
incomparable language render this poem one of intense charm. It was
intended for one of three great epics narrating the cycle of Hun legends;
of the other two we have only fragments. The romantic story of Wesselényi
and Mary Szécsi (see page 58), was made into a charming epic by Arany,
under the title “The capture of Murány” (“_Murány ostroma_,” 1849). In
“The Gypsies of Nagy Ida” (“_A nagyidai czigányok_,” 1852), Arany gave
vent, in form of a satirical burlesque, to his profound sorrow over his
country’s decadence, after the suppression of the liberal movement in
1848-1849. His ballads are generally considered to represent the best
specimens of Magyar ballad-writing. It must certainly be conceded that
few ballad-writers, whether in or outside Hungary, have so completely
hit the true ballad-tone, or internal ring of thought and word adapted
to subjects so utterly out of keeping with our modern sentiment. It
may be doubted whether Chopin himself in his ballad in F major has so
felicitously intuned the lay of olden romance as has Arany in his mostly
sombre ballads, such as “Duel at midnight” (“_Éjféli párbaj_”), “Knight
Pázmán” (“_Pázmán lovag_”), “Marfeast” (“_Ünneprontók_”). As in the best
English or German ballads, events are, as a rule, only indicated, not
described, and hurry on to their fatal termination with terrible speed.
All is action and fierce movement.

In addition to his activity as a creative poet, Arany also did much
for the introduction of foreign and classical literature into Hungary
by way of translations. His most successful work in that line were the
translations of several dramas of Shakespeare (_Hamlet_, _Midsummer
Night’s Dream_, _King John_), and more especially still his most
exquisite (—_pace_ all the German philologists!—) translation of the
comedies of Aristophanes.

We ought now to devote a considerable space to a poet who, in his time,
was generally associated with Petőfi and Arany. We mean Michael Tompa
(1817-1868). While it is now impossible to rank Tompa with either Petőfi
or Arany, he yet occupies a very conspicuous place in Magyar literature.
His intense love of nature, his profound religious sentiment, and his
fine humour entitle him to be considered as foremost amongst the lesser
lyrical glories of Hungary. We can only regret that we cannot give here
more than this bare indication of the peculiar individuality of the
author of the “Flower-fables” (_Virágregék_).




CHAPTER XXIX.


The dramatic literature of the Hungarians, as may be seen from the
preceding chapters, was, at the beginning of the twenties of this
century, in a most backward condition. For reasons that it is very
difficult to ascertain, some of the most dramatic nations, such as
the Italians, have rarely or never excelled in drama-writing; while
the English, who do not claim to be either conspicuously emotional or
dramatic, have given the world the incomparable dramas of Shakespeare.
In Italy, the lack of great dramatists may perhaps be ascribed to the
fact, that female parts were, at least down to the end of the last
century, played by boys. Yet a glance at the Attic theatre deprives this
reason of much of its value. Be this as it may, the great influence of
theatres and acting on dramatists can scarcely be denied. In Hungary,
at any rate, the very indifferent condition of the theatre in the first
three decades of the century bulks large amongst the causes producing
a dearth of good Magyar dramas. This becomes evident when we consider
that the first really great drama of a Magyar writer, “Banus Bánk”
(“_Bánk bán_”), by Katona, passed unnoticed for over fourteen years
(1818-1834), until a great actor, Gabriel Egressy, made it popular. The
Hungarians are naturally good actors, and very fond of theatre-going.
It will perhaps scarcely be believed in the enlightened west, where so
late as November, 1897, one of the leading daily papers of England was
permitted to speak of English and French literature as the only two
great literatures of the modern world, that in Hungary there has been,
and for some time too, a wealth of dramas of an intrinsic value at least
as great as that of any British drama written within the last hundred
and fifty years, and played by actors and actresses fully the equals of
their colleagues at the _Comédie Française_. This remarkable growth of
dramatic literature in Hungary did not, however, begin before the fourth
decade of the present century. The epics and ballads of Vörösmarty,
Garay, Czuczor, etc., seemed to captivate the public to the exclusion
of all other forms of poetry. The patriotic tune ringing, and expected
to ring through all popular works previous to the Revolution of 1848,
threw their authors into the worship of the heroic past and thus into
Romanticism. It was, accordingly, quite natural that dramatists, in
order to catch the public ear, indulged rather in heroic ranting and
tirades, than in dramatic characterization. The heroes of the tragedies
of Charles Kisfaludy (see page 116), for instance, are rhetoric blown
into the shape of persons. Everything Magyar is perfect; the Magyars are
delicately reminded, in pages full of endless adulation, that they are,
to use an American phrase, “the greatest, the best fed, and the best
clad nation on the face of the globe.” Their heroes are the greatest;
their past the most glorious. This sort of jingoism may be tolerated in
epics and ballads, where other redeeming features may save the literary
value of the work. In dramas it is fatal. Yet it is in the drama where
Romanticism may attain to really perfect works. The writer of romantic
ballads must, in the end, fall into the snares of an exaggerated
patriotism, and thus vitiate his work, rendering it less acceptable to
a sober and unchauvinistic posterity. The dramatic writer, on the other
hand, need not necessarily run the same risk. If he has power to chisel
out of the given material of a nation’s past one or the other truly
human character in all its grandeur, and in all its shortcomings, then
the historic staging and bygone emotional atmosphere of the past will
serve only to set off the dramatic beauties of the work all the more
plastically. Arany’s Edward I. in the “Bards of Wales” (see page 200), is
a ruthless and senseless tyrant that must pall on us in the end. Richard
III., on the other hand, can never pall on us; for in him we recognize
many an unavowed demon ravaging our own souls. Arany’s Edward I. is a
ballad-figure; Shakespeare’s Richard III. is a piece of true humanity. To
the dramatic poet it is indifferent from what part of the globe he takes
his material; for humanity is spread all over the planet. So a nation’s
heroic past too may be quite welcome to him, provided he is a real
dramatist. Katona was such. He is rough and inharmonious in language,
but there is real dramatic life in his men and women. For the first time
in Hungarian Literature the true tone of tragedy was heard. The terrible
fate of the Banus comes home to hearers, Hungarian or otherwise; it is
yawning out of the abyss of conflicts to which all of us are liable. He
is a loyal subject of his king, and yet bursts out in open rebellion; nay
worse, he kills his queen. He is a great patriot; yet finally makes a
rebellious plot with a foreign adventurer. He is a perfect nobleman; yet
ultimately breaks all the laws of true nobility. He is a loving husband;
yet contemplates assassinating his beautiful wife. And as he is, so are
the other persons of the drama. In them is pictured the conflicting
nature of the human heart and character as it really is: rough,
unbending, false, yet capable of sublime self-abnegation. Or as Petőfi
says: “Rain from heaven turning mud on earth.” The plot is as follows:
Bánk, in the absence of King Andrew II. of Hungary justiciar of the
country, has reason to believe that Gertrude, the haughty and unpopular
queen, countenances the vile designs of her brother Otto on Bánk’s
beautiful wife Melinda. A rebellion of the malcontent nobles under Petur
is breaking out. Bánk, who ought to quell it by virtue of his office, is
thrown out of his moral equilibrium by the news that Melinda has been
seduced by Otto. Forgetful of his position, he obeys only the behests of
his outraged soul and kills Gertrude. The king returns, the rebellion is
put down, and Bánk perishes. In Katona’s drama there is more power than
form. It will easily be understood that his chief model was Shakespeare.
He himself did not live to see the great success of his only masterpiece;
he died broken-spirited in 1830 at Kecskemét, in the thirty-eighth year
of his luckless life.

The first remarkable Hungarian dramatist after Katona is Edward
Szigligeti (his real name was Joseph Szatmáry), 1814-1878. From an early
date he was in constant contact with the theatre and with actors, and so
acquired great practical knowledge of stage-lore. He had deeply studied
the art of stage effect, and all his very numerous dramatic works testify
to an extraordinary stage-craft. It would, however, be unfair to compare
him to writers like Kotzebue in Germany, or Labiche in France. His
routine, no doubt, was pre-eminent in many of his pieces; yet, beside and
beyond the mere cleverness of the playwright, he had real _vis comica_
and a profound knowledge of Hungarian society. During his life-time that
society was slowly but steadily emerging from the semi-civilized state
of the former patriarchalism to the forms and usages of modern life. In
such periods of transition there is ample material for anyone gifted
with a keen sense of humour. The aping of western manners (ridiculed in
“_Marna_,” 1857; “Female Rule” [“_Nőuralom_” 1862], etc.); the humour
of the altered family-life (“Three Matrimonial Commands” [“_Házassági
három parancs_,”] 1850; “Stephen Dalos” [_Dalos Pista_], 1855; etc.);
odd remnants of the former social state, such as tramping actors, the
still-life of small towns; all this Szigligeti knew how to dramatize
with great effect. Like Charles Kisfaludy he drew with great felicity on
the stores of drastic humour pervading a conservative society composed
of many a discrepant element and moving onwards on entirely new lines
of development. He tried his skilful hand at tragedies too, and “The
Shadows of Light” (“_A fény árnyai_,” 1865,) and “The Pretender” (“_A
trónkereső_”, 1868,) are said to be meritorious. His rare stage-craft
and witty dialogue alone, however, could not have raised his name to
the height on which it rests, and where in all probability it will
continue to rest. Szigligeti’s name is justly famous for being the real
founder of what, for lack of a better name in English, must be called
the Hungarian folk-drama. In England there is no such thing, and no such
word. Already in our remarks on Arany (see page 195), we essayed to show
that the continental peasantry is generically different from any class
of small farmers in England. That peasantry is, in reality, a world of
its own. It is as much a world of its own, as is the well-known world
of the “upper ten.” He who has never been in what the knowing call “_le
monde_,” will easily confound the sentiments and thoughts of his own
world with those of the “_monde_.” Yet the two worlds are two worlds
indeed. Their whole tone and rhythm of life is different. They are
written not only in different scales but also for different instruments.
It is even so with the world of peasantry in Hungary or in Austria. How
silly of some painfully enlightened people to ascribe, for instance, the
mass of prejudice and superstition in the Hungarian or German peasantry
to a lack of that “_Bildung_” or school-knowledge which is acquired
through books and bookmen! The current belief in witches, fairies, imps
and such-like elf-folk, good and bad, grows with the peasantry of those
countries, out of the same roots that nourish in the “higher classes”
the craving for and the delight in fairy operas and fantastic novels.
Each social “world” demands pleasures and distractions of the same kind;
each satisfying that craving in a different manner. The urban gentleman
and lady while away tedious winter evenings by visits to theatres, where
unlikely, demoniac and over-exciting pieces are an everyday occurrence.
The peasants in Hungary have no such theatres; yet long winter evenings
hang just as heavily on their hands. They therefore while away their
leisure-hours by stories fantastic and demoniac, the literal belief
in which must needs grow in direct proportion to the lack of all
theatrical stage environment. As with superstitions, so it is with all
the other great social needs. The Hungarian peasant, when outraged in
his sentiments, does not, it is true, fight a duel like the gentleman.
Yet he, too, becomes a duellist, retiring into the woods, and fighting
society at large as a “_szegény legény_” or brigand. _Plus cela change,
plus c’est la même chose._

It will now be perhaps somewhat clearer that the Hungarian peasantry,
_qua_ peasantry, lends itself to dramatization in the same way as
does any other of the “worlds of men.” The common humanity of men is
to be found in that peasantry too; but it is modified, coloured, and
discoloured, “timbred” and attuned in a different mood. It admits of
tragedies proper; of comedies; and of burlesques. It is Szigligeti’s
great merit to have discovered this new dramatic ore. Without in the
least trying to diminish his glory, we cannot but add, that through the
great revolution coming over Hungary as over the rest of Europe, in the
period from the third to the seventh decade of this century, a revolution
social no less than political, the peculiar and distinct character of
the world of peasants became, by contrast to the rising _bourgeoisie_
and the changing nobility, much more easily discernible than it had been
ever before in Hungary. Yet Szigligeti was the first to seize on that
dramatic _res nullius_; and both for this discovery and the excellent
specimens of folk-dramas which he wrote, he deserves all credit. His most
remarkable folk-dramas are: “The Deserter” (“_Szökött Katona_,” 1843);
“The _Csikós_” (1846); and “The Foundling” (“_Lelencz_,” 1863).

We can here only mention the dramas of Sigismund Czakó, who for some time
before his voluntary death in 1847, was very popular; of Charles Obernyik
(1816-1855); and of Ignatius Nagy; the two latter being very popular
before the Revolution of 1848, owing to their excessively “patriotic”
dialogues. A far higher place in Hungarian dramatic literature is due
to the noble Count Ladislas Teleky, who also died by his own hand. His
“The Favourite” (“_A Kegyencz_,” 1841), the subject of which is taken
from the time of the Roman Emperor Valentinian III., is credited with
great force of irony, dramatic truth and power of imagination. In Charles
Hugo (_recte_ Charles Hugo Bernstein), 1817-1877, the Hungarian drama
might have gained a dramatic power of rare quality, had the overweening
self-infatuation of the author, together with his poor knowledge of
Magyar, not rendered him a victim to his first success. He is one of the
numerous Titans of the Hungarian capital, who cannot do anything half-way
creditable unless they fail to gain reputation. No sooner do they become
“famous,” than they cease to be either interesting or productive. Hugo’s
“Banker and Baron” (“_Bankár és Báró_”) had not only a great, but an
extraordinary success. Not only incense was strewn before the poet,
but, to use Lessing’s phrase, the very censer was hurled at his head.
The enthusiastic crowd carried the author bodily from the theatre to
his favourite _Café_. This unhinged poor Hugo’s mental equilibrium. He
considered himself a second Victor Hugo; and so never wrote any other
great drama. The merit of “Banker and Baron” is very considerable. It
is one of the then few attempts at writing a real _bourgeois_ drama, in
which the common human heritage of virtues and vices, affections and
passions, is presented with great force and dramatic vivacity.

Of a style and tone quite different from the preceding dramas is the
“dramatic poem,” as the author calls it, entitled “The Tragedy of Man,”
by Emericus Madách (1829-1864). In that great poem there is revealed
all the sombreness of profound melancholy, wailing over the bootless
struggle of Man since the unlucky moment of his creation. As the reader
may have noticed in the course of the present work, the Hungarians, as
a nation, are strongly inclined to pathos; just as the English are to
satire and the French to irony. In the youthful members of the Magyar
nation that bent is at times so strong as to dominate all the other modes
and faculties of the soul. Hence the astounding wealth of grave Largos in
Hungarian music, and the melancholy and despondent tone in many a great
work of Hungarian poetry. Few poems can compare in unaffected sadness
and thus twice saddening effect with Arany’s “_Epilogus_.” Madách’s
“Tragedy of Man” (“_Az ember tragédiája_”) is, as it were, the funeral
march of humanity. It would be utterly wrong to compare it to Goethe’s
“Faust.” Although there is a general similarity in the drift of the two
works, yet the poem of the luckless and suffering county official of
an obscure Hungarian province is essentially different from the drama
of the Jupiter of German literature. Madách’s poem is, reduced to its
skeleton, a philosophy of History. He takes us from the hour when Adam
and Eve were innocently walking in the Garden of Eden, to the times of
the Egyptian Pharaohs; then to the Athens of Miltiades; to sinking
Rome; to the adventurous period of the Crusaders; into the study of the
astronomer Kepler in the seventeenth century; thence into the horrors
of the French Revolution; into greed-eaten and commerce-ridden modern
London; nay, into the ultra-socialist state of the future, in which there
will be no family, no nation, and no individuality amongst the countless
individuals; and where the ideas of the preceding ages, such as Religion,
Art, Literature, will, by means of scientific formulæ, be shown up in all
their absurdity; still further, the poet shows the future of the earth,
when ice will cover the whole of its surface, and Europeans and other
human beings will be reduced to the state of a degraded brute dragging on
the misery of existence in some cave. In all these scenes, Adam, Eve and
the arch-fiend (Lucifer) are the chief and constantly recurring _personæ
dramatis_. In fact, all these scenes are meant to be prophetic dreams
of Adam, which Lucifer causes him to have in order to disgust him with
humanity in advance, and so, by driving him to suicide, to discontinue
humanity. In paradise, Adam learns and teaches the lesson of man’s
incapability of enduring bliss; in Egypt, Adam, as Pharaoh, experiences
the bottomless wretchedness of tyranny, where “millions live for the sake
of one;” in Athens he is made to shudder at the contemptible fickleness
of man when part of a crowd; in sinking Rome he stands aghast at the
corruptibility of mankind, and in the Crusades at their fanaticism; in
the study of Kepler he comprehends the sickening vanity of all attempts
at real knowledge, and in Paris he is shown the godless fury of a people
fighting for the dream called Liberty. So in the end, Adam, despairing
of his race, wants to commit suicide, when, in the critical moment, Eve
tells him that she is going to be a mother by him; whereby his intention
of discontinuing his race by suicide is baffled. Adam then prostrates
himself before God, who encourages him to hope and trust, making him
feel that man is part of an infinite and indestructible power, and will
struggle not quite in vain. Like Goethe’s Faust, the great poem of Madách
was not meant for the stage; yet, like Faust, it has proved of intense
effect on the stage too. It is, as may be seen, a philosophic poem
excelling rather in the beauty and loftiness of the thoughts conveyed
or suggested than by power of characterization or dramatic vigour. In
general literature we should like to compare it most to the “_De rerum
natura_” of Lucretius. The powerful melancholy of the Roman is of a kind
with the gloom of the Hungarian; and while the former dwells more on the
material and religious aspect of man, and the latter on social phenomena
in all their width and breadth, yet both sing the same tempestuous
_nocturne_ of Man’s sufferings and shortcomings, illuminating the night
of their despondency by stars of luminous thought. Madách died at too
early an age to finish more than this one masterpiece. His other poems
are inferior.

Dramatic literature in Hungary in the last thirty years has been growing
very rapidly; and both the drama of the “world” _folk_, and that of
the “world” _monde_ has met with very gifted, nay, in some cases,
exceedingly gifted writers. During that period, Hungary has completely
regained its absolute autonomy, and the Hungarian State, from having
had an annual revenue of not quite sixteen millions in 1867, has now a
revenue of over forty million pounds a year. Budapest has grown to be a
town of over six hundred thousand inhabitants; and the general progress
of Hungary, material as well as intellectual, social and political, has
been such as, relatively, that of no other country in Europe in the
same period. In the midst of the dramatic movement of all organs of
the Hungarian commonwealth, the drama proper could not but make great
strides too. It is here impossible to do justice to each of the very
numerous and talented Hungarian dramatists of our day. We should only
like, in treating of a necessarily small number of modern Hungarian
writers of dramatic works, to premise a remark in the interest of a
better understanding of their literary value. The English or American
public are, as a rule, very much inclined to think little of things
of which they have “never heard.” We are not blaming them for that.
Reading as they do great newspapers every day, they naturally come to
think that, to alter the old legal phrase, “what is not to be found in
the ‘paper,’ that does not exist.” Hungarian dramas are seldom or never
translated for the English stage; they are never talked about in the
press; hence, the general public will tacitly assume that they can be
worth but little. However, it is with Hungarian dramas as with Hungarian
fruit. Although Hungary produces exquisite fruit of all kinds, and in
enormous quantities too, the English consumer of fruit has never heard of
“Hungarian apples” or “Hungarian grapes,” while he is quite familiar with
American or Tasmanian apples of an inferior quality. The reason of that
is simple: the Hungarians are still in the infancy of the great art of
export. It is even so with the Hungarian drama. It is not being cleverly
enough exported; it wants active agents and middlemen to bruit it about.
We venture to say that the western nations are the losers by ignoring
or overlooking, as they do, the modern Hungarian drama. In taking the
trouble to make the acquaintance of the dramas of Eugene Rákosi, Edward
Tóth, Gregory Csiky, Lewis Dóczi, Lewis Dobsa, Joseph Szigeti, John
Vajda, Árpád Berczik, Stephen Toldy, Anton Várady, Lewis Bartók, etc.,
etc., they would find that together with the greatest European mines
for ore proper, Hungary has also many a profound mine of ore dramatic,
no less than fine specimens of coins minted out of that ore. There is
now a “tradition” of no inconsiderable duration in the art of acting;
and several actors of the very first quality, such as Rose Laborfalvy
(the late Mrs. Jókai), Louise Blaha, Lendvay, Egressy, etc., have set
examples and models, inspiring both the poet and the actor. The theatres
at Budapest are magnificently equipped, and being, as they are, part of
the great national treasure, they partake to a great extent of the nature
of a temple, and are visited, not as places of sheer distraction, but as
localities of national rallying and spiritual elevation.

Most of the leading dramatists of the last five-and-twenty years are
still alive, and it is, therefore, twice difficult to pass a final
judgment on their works. Mr. Eugene Rákosi, both as a journalist and a
drama-writer, occupies a very conspicuous place, and if better known in
the west of Europe, would certainly be read, and his pieces seen, with
marked interest. Like Mr. Dóczi, who is a high official in the common
department of Austria-Hungary, he has that subtle and unanalyzable force
of surrounding his scenes, and also frequently his persons, with the
splendour of poetic suggestiveness. In his “Endre and Johanna,” “Wars
of Queens” (“_Királynék harcza_”), “The School of Love” (“_Szerelem
iskolája_”), he does not make it his chief point to create, entangle,
still more embroil, and then finally solve a “problem,” although he is
a master of scene and situation-making. Nor do he and Mr. Dóczi care to
be “realists.” They are satisfied with being poets. Mr. Dóczi has in his
“The Kiss” (“_Csók_”) ventured on writing in words what hitherto has only
been a success in the tones of Mendelssohn: a drama moving in mid-air,
in midsummer night, with gossamery persons and fairy-ideas, away, far
away from our time and land. In that he has been signally successful, and
Mendelssohn’s overture to the “Midsummer Night’s Dream” is not sweeter
and airier than Mr. Dóczi’s “Kiss.” Like Mr. Rákosi, Mr. Dóczi is a
master of Hungarian and he wields the German idiom too with the same
grace and energy.

In our opinion Gregory Csiky (born 1842, died recently) was the strongest
dramatic talent amongst the modern dramatists in Hungary. He is what
people are pleased to call a “realist;” that is, his shafts are sunk into
the dramatic mines of the society in the midst of which he lives. His
strong satire and broad humour, his finely-chiselled language and the
bold and true way of his dramatization raise him to the level of the
best of contemporary dramatists in any country. In his “The Proletarians”
(“_A Proletárok_”) he has seized on a large class of _déclassés_ in
Hungary, who by the precipitated legislative reforms after 1867 were
deprived of their previous means of living, and so turned to parasitic
methods of eking out an existence. That class is brought to dramatic
life full of humorous, sad, and striking phenomena. There is not in this
drama, any more than in Csiky’s other dramas (“Bubbles” [“_Buborékok_”],
“Two Loves” [“_Két szerelem_”], “The Timid” [“_A szégyenlős_”],
“Athalia,” etc.) the slightest trace of that morbid psychologism which
has made the fortune of Ibsen. It is all sound, fresh, penetrating
and vibrating with true dramatic life. Last, not least, there is much
beauty of form and construction. Csiky, who has published very valuable
translations of Sophocles and Plautus, is thoroughly imbued with the
classic sense of form and with the real vocation of the drama as the
art-work showing the emotional and mental movements of _social_ types,
and not of some pathologic excrescence of society. In other words, he
does not muddle up, as Ibsen does, the novel with the drama.

Amongst the writers of “folk-dramas,” Edward Tóth (1844-1876), occupies
a very high place. His “The Village Scamp” (“_A falu rossza_”) tells
the touching story of a young peasant who, disappointed in love, loses
all moral backbone and is finally saved by the fidelity of a woman. The
drama is full of scenes taken from Hungarian peasant life, which is far
more dramatic than peasant life in Germany. The Hungarians have, till
quite recently, never had a Berthold Auerbach, or a novelist taking
the subject of his novels from peasant life. They have dramatists of
peasant life instead; and a short comparison with the peasant dramas
written by Austrians, such as those of Anzengruber, will show the decided
superiority of the Hungarians. One strong element in the folk-dramas
of Tóth and of Francis Csepreghy (1842-1880, author of “The Yellow
Colt” [“_A sárga csikó_”], “The Red Purse” [“_Piros bugyelláris_”]),
is the folk-poems and folk-songs, sung and danced. By this incidental
element of tone and verse, which, as a sort of inarticulate commentary
on the dramatic scenes does duty for the philosophic reflections of the
non-peasant drama, the hearer is brought into intimate touch with the
very innermost pulsation of the life of the “folk.”




CHAPTER XXX.


In now approaching the modern novel in Hungary we are at once met,
touched, almost overwhelmed by the dazzling light and lustre of one
commanding genius of the Magyar novel, Maurus Jókai. His name is at
present well-known all over the world, and his novels are eagerly read
by Hungarians and non-Hungarians alike. The number of his works is very
great, and although over fifty years have elapsed since the appearance of
his first novel (in 1846), he is still enriching Hungarian and European
literature with ever new works. Nearly everything has changed in Hungary
during the last forty years; but the love and admiration for the genius
of Jókai has never suffered diminution. In his checkered life there is
not a blot, and in his long career there is not a single dark spot.
Pure, manly, upright as a patriot, faithful and loving as a husband,
loyal as a subject, kind as a patron, an indefatigable worker, and,
highest of all, a true friend both to men, fatherland, and literature,
he has given his nation not only great literary works to gladden and
enlighten them, but also a sterling example of Magyar virtue and Magyar
honour. It is, especially in Hungary, no common thing to meet with men of
Jókai’s immense power and love of work. His journalistic articles alone
would fill many a folio volume. His political activity in the Hungarian
Parliament, in the Lower House of which he was up to January, 1897,
when the king called him to the House of Magnates, was likewise very
extensive. And in addition to that, he was constantly writing novels,
turning out volume after volume, until the total exceeded two hundred
and fifty. In fact, as has been already hinted at, from an historic
point of view he has, by his unparalleled productiveness, done some harm
less to himself than to other Hungarian novelists. He himself, although
not equally at his best in every one of his novels, has in the course
of fifty-one years of creative authorship scarcely lost anything of the
distinctly individual greatness of his genius; and even the later and
sometimes hurried productions of his pen are, to say the least, most
excellent, because intensely interesting reading. On the other hand,
his very popularity rendered it almost impossible for any other Magyar
novelist to publish novels other than small sketches or essays. The
reading public in Hungary is not numerous enough to demand lengthy novels
from more than one favourite author. Jókai almost supplanted Jósika (see
page 140) and all other writers of lengthy novels.

His novels and sketches treat of nearly every aspect of Magyar life,
in the past and in the present. The heroic deeds of the ancient or
mediæval Magyars are subjects of his novels as well as the doings and
thoughts of official and non-official Hungary of the present century.
It would, however, be quite incorrect to ascribe to him any intention
of writing the “_Comédie humaine_” of Hungary. No such vast system
underlies his countless stories. He has no system; in reality, nothing
is more removed from his mind than any such big structure of ideas and
facts. He has frequently chosen non-Magyar subjects; and when treating
of Magyar events or institutions, he has no philosophical aim to pursue,
and no patriotic theory to uphold. He writes novels out of sheer love of
telling tales. In the feeblest of his works the reader cannot but notice
that singular alertness and freshness of an author hugely enamoured
of his profession—and gaily at work. The narrating is of much the
greater interest to him; the tale itself does not always claim his full
attention. Whether or no, the plot is consistently thought out to the
end; or, whether or no, the persons always proceed on the lines of their
characters; all that does not too much ruffle Jókai’s joyous composure
of authorship. For, to put it in one word, he is an improvisatore; in
fact, the greatest of all known improvisatori. This is the key to all his
excellencies, as well as to his alleged failings. The Teutonic nations,
and amongst the Latin ones the French are, as a rule, entirely unfamiliar
with that most fascinating of talking virtuosi, the _improvisatore_.
Even in the wild excitement of the French Revolution there was only one
orator, Danton, who improvised his speeches; the rest, even Mirabeau,
read them. The vast amount of _parlature_ done in Hungary, to which we
called attention at the very outset of this work, has given rise both
to marvellous artists of the living word, and to audiences passionately
fond of listening to good talk, and on all possible occasions too. The
good talker in America is a man who _à propos_ of any occurrence, is
reminded of a story that happened “in Denver, Colorado, or Columbus,
Ohio.” No such individual would be endured in Hungary. The good talker
there is an improvisatore proper. He is never “reminded” of an old story;
he invents on the spot or extracts from the actual topic of conversation
all the sparks of wit and humour that fall upon the prose of life like
dew upon dry flowers. The gift and long habit of improvisation thus
makes some of those mostly unknown artists most charming companions
and astoundingly clever talkers. He who has not lived amongst them,
cannot possibly imagine their ease of invention, their humour, their
power of description and their imagination. They are not, as in Italy,
professional improvisatori; and perhaps nobody would be more astounded
than themselves at the application of that term to them. Yet, a
comparison with the man in France, who is “_bon causeur_,” and with the
man in London, who has “remarkable conversational powers,” will show any
unprejudiced observer the truth of the above characterization of the
Magyar talker. Just as Mark Twain’s humour is only the improved and,
by print, fixed humour noticeable in many an American, even so Jókai’s
narrative genius is the highest form of that genius for improvisation
which in Hungary may be met with frequently in lesser perfection. This
explains Jókai’s permanent hold on the Hungarian nation. He has carried
one great gift of his nation to the heights of real greatness. We repeat
it: he is the greatest of all improvisatori in prose. Nothing can
approach his miraculous facility in building up a fascinating scene;
in irradiating the heaviest and most cumbrous subject with light and
humour; and in wafting over the whole tale the Fata Morganas of an
exuberant imagination. Young and old; Hungarian, Englishman or German;
man or woman; they must all stand still and listen to the charmer. That
Jókai is the best exponent of the Hungarian genius for improvisation
in words will be readily believed and accepted, when we point out his
startling similarity, almost identity, with another famous Hungarian,
who excelled in works of the same quality but written in tones instead
of in words. We mean Liszt. Jókai is the Liszt of Hungarian Literature;
we might almost say, of European literature. The marvellous musician,
who, both as a pianist and as a composer, held the civilized world under
his spell for far over seventy years—(Liszt was born in 1811 and died in
1887)—was the king of all musical improvisatori. When he played Beethoven
or Chopin, Bach or Schumann, he impressed the most cool-headed hearers
as if he had just improvised the pieces he played; that one circumstance
being at the same time the secret of his unrivalled powers as a pianist.
When he composed—and many, very many of his compositions are works of
lasting merit—the result was almost invariably an improvisation. It
has that indefinable charm of rapturous glow kindled at the fire of
the moment, which endows improvisations with a character unique and
exceptional. It excels in major keys far more than minor moods; it has
much unity of character and _Stimmung_ rather than unity of form; it
always borders on the _Fantasia_, and never crystallizes into a sonata
proper; it cultivates side-issues, such as flourishes and _fioriture_
with startling skill and vast effect, while the bass, or the underlying
element of thought, is not laboured nor significant; it appeals to happy
people rather than to such as bear heavy burdens; and it works for
brilliancy more than for reticent beauty. Liszt’s E flat major concerto,
for instance, is an absolutely faithful replica of some of Jókai’s best
novels. Both authors excel in brilliancy, technical routine, wealth of
imagination, sparkling rhythms and rapturous descriptiveness. There is
nothing majestic in them, nothing grave, nothing truly sad or melancholy.
Jókai disposes of an inexhaustible humour. This, as will be admitted,
cannot be readily imitated in music. In Liszt, humour becomes irony and
demoniac scorn. His Polonaise in E major, for example, with its appalling
irony at Polish excessiveness, is the musical counterpart to Jókai’s
humour. But where Liszt comes nearest to Jókai is in his Rhapsodies. As
in Jókai, so in Liszt, there is a constant change of panoramic views;
an exquisite wealth of tinkling, sparring and glistening rhythms; a
shower of glittering dewdrops and an iridescence of sheets of coloured
lights. In a measure, all Jókai’s novels are placed in fairy-land; as all
Liszt’s music is on the heights of exultation. And, likewise, the final
secret of Jókai’s irresistible charm is in the improvisatory character
of his novels. Jókai’s reader does not feel that he is being lectured
or moralized or instructed. On the contrary, he feels that he himself,
in inspiring, as it were, the author, is co-operating with him in the
work, just as the listeners to an improvisatore are doing. The reader is
accorded part of the exquisite delight of literary creation and so feels
twice happy.

This peculiar and inimitable feature and excellence of Jókai is but
another manifestation of the rhapsodic character of the Magyars. Petőfi,
and he alone, was in his best poems, both rhapsodic and classical.
He not only expressed Magyar rhapsodism lyrically, as has Jókai
novelistically and Liszt musically, but he also imparted to it that
inner form of moderation and harmonious beauty which, if coupled with
perfect expression and metre, renders poetry classical. It will now be
easily seen why Jókai must needs have the failings of his virtues. The
very nature of rhapsodic improvisations works chiefly for effect: it
is subjective art, not objective. The production of the artist is not
severed from his personality; it is intimately allied with and dependent
on it. In Liszt, whose art admits of combining both production and
presentation of the work at one and the same time, the subjective or
personal factors became so strong as to render him without any doubt
the most fascinating artistic individuality of this century. It is,
therefore, in vain to expect in Jókai that patient and self-denying
care of the objective artist for the structural beauty of his work.
It is not the great number of his novels that has prevented him from
giving them as much objective proportion and consistency as they have
lustre and charm. Mozart died at five-and-thirty, and left more works
than Jókai has written; yet nearly every one of the better ones was
objectively faultless. It is Jókai’s very art that necessitates that
failing in Art. If he had tried to mend it, he would have stunted some
of that peerless profusion of fancy which has endeared him to untold
millions. He may displease a few hundreds; he will always transport
the millions. Yet one remark cannot be suppressed. Hungary, we are
convinced, has not yet arrived at the stage of literary development
when critics and the public look backwards for the best efforts of the
nation’s intellect. There are still immense possibilities for Hungarian
Literature; and all the constellations of literary greatness have not
yet risen above the horizon. It will thus not be surprising when we here
venture to urge the necessity of viewing even a genius such as Jókai’s
historically. His merits are as boundless as his charm. The judgment
of all Europe has confirmed that. For Hungarians, however, it will be
wise to remember, that Jókai in literature, as Liszt in music, are the
highest types indeed, but of one phase only of the many-souled national
genius of the Hungarian people. Their work is great and inimitable; we
hasten to add: nor should it be imitated. It is the work, not of the
last, but of one of the early stages in Hungarian Literature. It has,
when over-estimated, a tendency to do harm to the nation. People, who
in music are taught to expect the maddening accents of rhapsodies, will
rarely calm down to the enjoyment of less spiced, if more perfect music.
It is even so with novels. Who now reads the novels of Kemény (see page
157); and who ought not to read them? Readers intoxicated with Jókai, we
readily admit, cannot fairly rally to enjoy Kemény. Yet Hungary is badly
in need of a more modern Kemény, as she is of a Brahms. Or has it not
been noticed yet, that while Hungarians are proverbially musical, and
known to be so in all countries, they have so far—if we for the moment
disregard Liszt—not produced a single creative musician of European fame
or considerable magnitude? There can be little doubt that Liszt himself
is one of the chief causes of the sterilization of musical talent in
Hungary. Vainly endeavouring to imitate him, the composers failed to
proceed on different lines. Desiring to hear Hungarian music in no other
form than in that of Lisztian rhapsodies, the public failed to encourage
the production of new musical works. And so the vast treasure of
Hungarian music has not yet been done full justice. The Bohemians, also
a very musical nation, have had no Liszt; but they have, at least, their
Smetanas and their Dvořáks. As a reader and patriot, no less than as a
student of poetry and art, we joyfully recognize the surpassing talent
of both Jókai and Liszt. As historian of the literature of our nation,
we cannot but make the remark that it will no longer do for Hungarians
to leave the historical position of these two great authors entirely out
of consideration. It is different with countries outside Hungary. They
may and shall read Jókai unmolested by any such reflections. For them he
is delight pure and unequalled; and we beg their pardon for not having
suppressed the above remark. But as to the interests of Hungary we dare
to assume that Jókai himself, great in modesty as he is in so many other
ways, will not disavow our idea, but gladly acknowledge that, great as he
may be, there ought to be room for novelistic greatness of another kind
in Hungarian Literature, and appreciation of other modes of novelistic
art in the Hungarian public.

Jókai was born on the nineteenth of February, 1825, at Komárom (Komorn).
At Pápa, when still a student, he made the acquaintance of Petőfi, whose
intimate friend he became. He took an active, if moderate part, in the
revolution, and came near falling into the hands of the victorious
Austrians, from which fatal predicament, however, he was saved by his
lovely wife Rose Laborfalvy, one of the greatest of Hungarian actresses.
From that time onward he has devoted his life partly to parliamentary
activity, but chiefly to literature and the political press. In the
latter field he has acted as editor of, and frequent contributor to,
several of the leading journals of Hungary; and, moreover, as founder and
editor of the “_Üstökös_,” the Hungarian “_Punch_.” In Hungary, where
political and parliamentary life has long been in existence, a paper _à
la_ “_Punch_” was a natural and much needed literary product. Nor do we
hesitate to assert that several of such papers—for instance, Jókai’s
“_Üstökös_” (“The Comet”), and the incomparable Porzó’s (Dr. Adolf Ágai)
“_Borszem Jankó_” (a name) not only equal, but, as a rule, decidedly
surpass German or French “_Punches_,” and not infrequently the London
paper too. Wit in Hungary is of a peculiar kind, and Jókai is one of its
most gifted devotees. It is wit, not only of situations, or humorous
contrasts, but also of linguistic contortionism, if we may so express
it; so that none but a master of the language can handle it with real
success. On the other hand, it is fertile in humorous types, and does not
indulge—unwillingly at least—in caricature.

Amongst Jókai’s novels, “An Hungarian Nabob” (“_Egy magyar nábob_,”
1856, translated into English) is one of his earlier masterworks. It
tells the story of one of those immensely wealthy Hungarian noblemen who,
in pre-revolutionary times, lived like small potentates on their vast
estates, surrounded by wassailing companions, women, gamblers, fools,
gypsies, and an indefinite crowd of hangers-on. The old Kárpáthy, the
nabob, in spite of habitual excesses of all kinds, is, at bottom, an
upright and proud man. The intrigues made against him by a profligate
nephew, hitherto his only heir, and who wants to precipitate his death,
are baffled by the nabob’s marriage with a young and innocent girl,
who makes him the father of a boy, Zoltán. Within this apparently very
simple framework what a wealth of scenes, of types, of humour, and
descriptive gems! We are taken from the half-savage manor-life of the
old nabob to brilliant Paris, then again to Pozsony and to Pest. The
language is winged, winning, and gorgeously varied. The continuation of
the “Nabob” is given in “_Kárpáthy Zoltán_,” a novel which, both in its
pathos and in its humour, is one of the most engaging pieces of modern
narrative literature. Full of historic interest are Jókai’s “The Golden
Era of Transylvania” (“_Erdély arany kora_,” translated into English by
Mr. Nisbet Bain); “The Sins of the Heartless Man” (“_A kőszivü ember
fiai_”); “Political Fashions” (“_Politikai divatok_”); “The Lady with
the Sea-Eyes” (“_A tengerszemü hölgy_”); and in “The New Landlord” (“_Az
új földesúr_”) Jókai has, without so much as posing as a political
moralist, achieved one of the best effects of patriotic moralizing. “The
New Landlord” is perhaps one of the most finished and architectonically
perfect of the Hungarian master’s works, although the workmanship of
“What we are growing old for” (“_Mire megvénűlünk_”) is also remarkable.
Other novels in which Jókai’s splendour of imagination and narrative
genius may be enjoyed at their best are: “Love’s Fools” (“_Szerelem
bolondjai_”); “Black Diamonds” (“_Fekete gyémántok_,” translated into
English); “There is no Devil” (“_Nincsen ördög_”); “The Son of Rákóczy”
(“_Rákóczy fia_”); “Twice Two is Four” (“_Kétszer kettő négy_”), etc.
Besides works of fiction, exceeding two hundred and fifty volumes, Jókai
has written an interesting History of Hungary; his memoirs; the Hungarian
part of the late Crown Prince Rudolf’s great work on Austria-Hungary,
etc. He is still enriching Hungarian Literature with ever new works of
fiction.




CHAPTER XXXI.


In the preceding chapters we have essayed to give some idea of the
work of the leading poets and writers of Magyar literature. The very
narrow limits of this sketch of the literary life of the Hungarians have
prevented us from giving more than mere outlines; and in now approaching
the activity of modern Hungarian poets and writers of less prominent
position, although not infrequently of very considerable value, we are
forced to restrict ourselves to still more limited appreciation.

Amongst the _Novel-writers_ we cannot omit to mention Louis Kúthy
(1813-1864), Ignatius Nagy (1810-1856), and Gustavus Lauka. The two
latter excelled in light, humorous novels. In the humoristic sketches and
tales of Gereben Vas (_nom de plume_ for Joseph Radákovics, 1823-1867)
there is a continuous and, as to its language, admirable display of the
fireworks of folk-wit and racy fun. Amongst his best works are “Great
Times—Great Men” (“_Nagy idők nagy emberek_”); “Law-Students’ Bohemian
Life” (“_Jurátus élet_”). Albert Pálffy (born in 1823), after a long
career as an influential politician and journalist, has published, since
1892, a great number of sound, readable novels. Aloisius Degré (born
in 1820), of French extraction, has always been a popular writer with
readers of society-novels. Charles Bérczy (1823-1867) is the founder of
sport-literature in Hungary; in his novels he follows chiefly English
models. A peculiar position is occupied by Ladislas Beöthy who, in the
evil decade of Austrian reaction (1850-1860) amused and consoled his
despondent countrymen by his eccentric humour and originality. In the
historic novels of Charles Szathmáry (1830-1891) there is more patriotism
than literary power. Both as a journalist (as editor of the “_Fővárosi
Lapok_”) and as an author of elegant and thoughtful novels, Charles
Vadna (born 1832) has won a conspicuous place for himself. Alexander
Balázs (1830-1887); Arnold Vértesi (born 1836); Lewis Tolnai (born
1837); William Győry (1838-1885); Miss Stephania Wohl (1848-1889); Emil
Kazár (born in 1843); have in numerous novels, many of which would merit
particular attention, painted the sad or gay aspects of life. Louis
Abonyi (born in 1833), Alexander Baksay (born in 1832), Ödön Jakab, and
Bertalan Szalóczy count among the best Hungarian novelists whose subjects
are taken from the life of the Magyar peasantry. As we have already
suggested, the number of Hungarian writers venturing on a novelistic
_poetisation_ of life on a grand scale, is not very great at present.
Most of the modern novelists just mentioned work on a smaller scale; and
thus the Hungarian Bret Harte did not fail to make his appearance. His
name is Coloman Mikszáth (born in 1849). His short and thoroughly poetic
tales from the folk-life of Hungary are in more than one respect superior
to those of the American writer. For, to the latter’s sweet conciseness
of plan and dialogue, Mikszáth adds the charm of _naïveté_. Some of his
works have been translated into German, French and English; and the
enthusiasm for his art will no doubt spread from Hungary to all other
countries where the graces of true simplicity can still be enjoyed.

Amongst the numerous writers of _genre_-sketches and _feuilletons_,
“Porzó” or Dr. Ágai is _facile princeps_; not only in Hungary, but also,
we venture to add, in all Europe. He is quite unique.




CHAPTER XXXII.


The number of _lyrical poets_ is very great in modern Hungary. It may
be stated that, as a rule, a Magyar poet has more chances of attracting
public attention by a good lyrical poem than by a good novel. Perhaps
the female portion of Hungary are not as anxious for novel-reading, as
are their sisters in more western countries; and thus the balance of
attention to poetic works is spent on the drama and on lyrics. This fact
is on a line with the predilection of the Hungarian public for songs and
airs, as against native musical works of a more extensive description.
The great Hungarian lyrical poets of modern times may properly be divided
into several groups, of which the first is the school of poets with
whom the beauty and purity of Form is the principal concern of their
art. Considering the innate Magyar tendency to rhapsodic and shapeless
exuberance, the relative value of the works of that group is very great.
The Hungarian language, just on account of its large share of musical
elements, has somewhat of that indistinctness and vague emotionality
which, like that of music, must be strictly kept within the bounds of
Form. Even in the more advanced poetry of the Teutonic nations, whether
German or English, the significance of poets cultivating pre-eminently
the chaste beauty of Form, is still very considerable. Fortunately for
Hungary, both Paul Gyulai (born in 1826) and Charles Szász (born in
1829) have, especially the latter, untiringly worked at providing their
countrymen with works of poetry, original or otherwise, in which the
law and beauty of Form predominate over emotionalism. Szász has thus
deserved very highly of Hungarian Literature. His delicate sense of
metre, rhythm and architectonics, in his original epics and lyrics, as
well as in his exceedingly numerous translations from the works of great
western poets, is on a par with the wealth of his linguistic resources;
and while English poetry may perhaps afford to be less encouraging to the
adepts of Form, Magyar literature is to be congratulated upon having at
once recognized and thereby not missed the numerous works of her Richard
Garnett.

To this group belongs also Joseph Lévay (born in 1825), whose popular
works move in the sphere of elevated serenity.

Another group of lyrical poets is formed by the nationalists, who vied
with one another in sounding exclusively the note of Magyar sentiments
and ideas proper. Local colour seemed to be everything, and in language
and subject nothing was used outside the purely Magyar elements. The most
gifted of that class was Coloman Tóth (1831-1881); next to him ranks
perhaps Andrew Tóth (1824-1885); nor must Coloman Lisznyay (1823-1863),
Joseph Zalár (born in 1827), and Joseph Székely (born in 1825) be omitted.

Quite by himself stands John Vajda (born in 1827). He is to Hungarian
poetry proper, what Kemény (see pp. 153, etc.) is to Hungarian novelistic
literature. His is the gloom and power of pessimism; and in his fight
with Destiny he conjures up all the furies of scorn, despair, rage and
hatred: see especially his “_Szerelem átka_” and “_Gina emléke_.”

The lyrical poets of the sixties and seventies of this century tried to
avoid excessive nationalism, true to the spirit of the time when Hungary
through the final regulation of her constitution as an autonomous state,
assumed a European attitude herself. The more prominent names are Béla
Szász; Victor Dalmady; Joseph Komócsy; Lewis Tolnai; Ladislas Arany,
Alexander Endrődi, Julius Reviczky, etc. In Joseph Kiss there is much of
that power of discovering poetic riches in subjects hitherto ignored by
poets, which goes to make the really great poet. The emotional conflicts
between orthodox Jews and Christian peasants living in the same village,
conflicts of love and hatred alike, have been worked into powerful
ballads by Kiss.




CHAPTER XXXIII.


It would be impossible, to write even the shortest sketch of Hungarian
Literature without dwelling on one of the less conspicuous, yet chief
sources of suggestion and inspiration of Hungarian poets. We mean the
_folk-poetry_ of the Hungarian people. Now that we can study that poetry
in numerous and comprehensive collections, published by John Erdélyi
(1848), Paul Gyulai and Ladislas Arany, John Kriza (1863), Lewis Kálmány,
Coloman Thaly (in English, the collection of L. Kropf and W. Jones,
“Magyar Folk-tales,” 1884), etc., etc., we cannot but acknowledge the
profound effect that these countless poems, ballads, songs, fables,
epics, and ditties must have had on the minds of Hungarian poets who
spent their youth in the midst of people singing, reciting or improvising
them. In intensity of colour, in fire and varied picturesqueness,
Hungarian folk-poetry is certainly not inferior to that of the people
of Italy. In humour and exuberant audacity it is probably its equal.
But while Italian folk-poetry frequently stoops to the indecent and
obscene, it may be said without fear of contradiction, that such stains
are unknown to the folk-poetry of the Magyars. In it lives the whole life
of that nation, its sorrows and humiliations, as well as its moments of
triumph and victory. The complete ethnography, historic and present,
of the Magyars could be gleaned from that poetry. Nay, so intense is
the poetic feeling of those lowly and obscure peasant-poets, that every
object of the rich nature of Hungary has been framed and illumined
by them. The _puszta_, and the two mighty rivers of the country; the
snow-clad Carpathians, and the immense lake of the Balaton; the abundant
flora and fauna of their land—all is there, instinct with poetic life
of its own, and embracing, sympathizing or mourning the life of the
shepherd, the outlaw (_betyár_), the lover, the priest, the trader, the
Jew, the constable, the squire, the maiden, the widow, the child. There
is in that folk-poetry a tinkling, ringing and pealing of all the bells
and organs of life. Like the music that almost invariably accompanies
it, it is teeming with intense power, and hurries on over the cascades
of acute rhythms, and the rapids of gusts of passion. As if every object
of Nature had revealed to it the last, brief secret of its being, it
describes scenes and situations in two or three words. Its wit is
harmless or cruel, just as it chooses; and in its humour the laughing
tear is not wanting. Chief of all, as the great pundits of Cairo or
Bagdad, whenever they are at sea about some of the enigmas of the idiom
of the Koran and the Makamat, send for advice to the roving Bedouins of
the Arabian deserts: so the Hungarian poets have gathered their best
knowledge of the recondite lore of the Magyar idiom, in the _pusztas_ of
the _Alföld_, between the Danube and the Theiss, where the true Magyar
peasant is living.

Hungarian folk-poetry is not a thing of the past. Almost day by day,
new and ever new “_nóták_” or songs are rising from the fields and
forests—nobody knows who composed them—and as if carried by the winds of
east and west, they quickly find their way into the heart of the whole
nation. There is thus an inexhaustible fountain of poetry and poetic
suggestiveness in the very nation of the Magyars. Great as some of the
Hungarian lyrical poets have been, it is fair to assume, that with such
an undercurrent of perennial folk-poetry to draw upon, there are, for
this reason alone, still many more great poets in store for us.




CHAPTER XXXIV.


In conclusion, a few words on the Hungarian literary productions outside
_belles-lettres_ proper. From the pre-eminently political character of
the Magyars, it may be inferred almost _a priori_ that questions bearing
on legal and constitutional matters have at all times been a favourite
subject with the writers and statesmen of Hungary. Previous to 1830,
in round numbers, these questions were treated mostly in Latin works.
Since then, however, a very considerable number of politico-legal and
politico-historical writers in Magyar has arisen. The most important
amongst them, both for the authority they commanded in practical
politics, and for the weight and power of their arguments, are Count
Stephen Széchenyi; Baron Nicolas Wesselényi; Count Aurelius Dessewffy;
Baron Joseph Eötvös (see pp. 142, etc.); the famous Lewis Kossúth,
probably the greatest political orator of the century; and Francis
Deák. They were all practical statesmen, and not mere scholars. Yet
most of their works on the constitution of Hungary, and especially on
the constitutional relation of Hungary to Austria, are also valuable
as sources of solid and scholarly information. Thus Deák showed the
extensiveness of his legal and politico-historical erudition in his
famous controversy with the Austrian professor Lustkandl, in no lesser
degree than his tact and wisdom in the conclusion of the final treaty
between Austria and Hungary in 1867. Eötvös enriched Magyar political
literature with an elaborate and thoughtful work on “The Influence of
the Dominant Ideas of the Nineteenth Century on the State” (“_A xix.
század uralkodó eszméinek befolyása az álladalomra_,” 1851-1854). In
more recent times a very great number of politico-legal monographs has
been published in Hungary. The student will find lists of them in the
works of Stephen Kiss and E. Nagy, both entitled “Constitutional Law of
Hungary” (“_Magyarország közjoga_,” the former in 1888, the latter, third
edition, 1896). Of older works on the constitutional law of Hungary,
the most useful are those of count Cziráky (1851, in Latin), and of
Professor Virozsil (also in Hungarian and German, 1865). Amongst the
numerous Magyar writers on _Jurisprudence_, Professor Augustus Pulszky is
well-known in England through his able work, written in English, on “The
Theory of Law and Civil Society” (1888).

In the department of _History_, and especially the history of Hungary,
the activity of the Magyars has been one of astounding intensity. In the
well-known annual bibliography of history, edited by Jastrow, in Berlin
(_Jahresberichte_, etc.), the annual report on the historical literature
published in Hungary, occupies a conspicuous space. The older historians
of Hungary, such as G. Pray (1774, 3 vols. fol.), Katona (1779-1817,
42 vols.), who wrote in Latin; and Engel (1814), Fessler (1825, 10
vols.), count John Majláth (1853, 5 vols.), who wrote in German, can
now be used only for occasional reference. Of Magyar writers on the
history of Hungary, Bishop Michael Horváth (1809-1878), and Ladislas
Szalay (1813-1864), have had the greatest influence on the reading
public and Magyar historiography up to the end of the seventies. The
bishop treats history in the style of fine and dignified ecclesiastical
allocutions. Szalay’s is a talent for the political and legal aspects
of history rather than for the personal and military element thereof.
In both historians there is a noble patriotism, and their works, even
if discarded as wanting in systematic research, will always claim a
high rank as literary productions. Hungary is still waiting for the
true historian of the whole of her history; but what other country is
not? Writers of historic monographs there are many, and they have done
excellent work. Some of the most prominent are Count Joseph Teleki
(1790-1855); Francis Salomon (born 1825); Anton Csengery (1822-1880);
Charles Szabó (1824-1890); Alexander Szilágyi (born 1830), the historian
of Transylvania; William Fraknói (born 1843, died recently), on Pázmány
and King Matthew; Julius Pauler (born 1841), whose great work on the
history of Hungary under the Árpáds (till 1301) is characterised by a
most careful study of all the original sources; Coloman Thaly (born
1839), whose “speciality” is the age of Francis Rákóczy II.; Emericus
Krajner (very valuable works on constitutional history); Lewis Thallóczy
(on relation to Balkan nations); Ignatius Acsády (on civilization and
finance of xvi. and xvii. cent.); Henry Marczali (on the age of Emperor
Joseph II.); Lewis Kropf, whose domicile is in London, and who, in a
long series of accurate and scholarly monographs has elucidated many
an important point of Hungarian history; G. Ladányi (constitutional
history); Sigismond Ormós (institutional history of the Árpádian
period); K. Lányi (ecclesiastical history); Alex. Nagy (institutional
history); F. Kubinyi (institutional history); S. Kolosváry and K. Óváry
(charters); L. Fejérpataky (charters); Árpád Kerékgyártó (history of
Magyar civilization); F. Balássy (institutional history); Professor
Julius Lánczy (institutional and Italian history); Baron Béla Radvánszky
(Magyar civilization); Emericus Hajnik (constitutional history);
Frederick Pesty (constitutional history); Wertner (most valuable works
on Hungarian genealogy), etc. Great also is the number of periodicals
systematically embracing all the aspects of Hungarian history; and
local societies effectively aid in the marshalling of facts, and in the
publication of ancient monuments. When the history of Austria, Poland,
and the Danubian countries has been written in a manner superior to what
we now possess in that respect, the history of Hungary too, will, we have
no doubt, find its adequate master among Magyar historians. The progress
in Magyar historiography has, in late years, been little short of that
made in any other country.

In the department of _literary history_ we notice the same lack of a
satisfactory general history of Hungarian Literature, and the same
abundance of meritorious monographs on single points. Francis Toldy
(formerly Schedel, 1805-1875), started a comprehensive history of
Hungarian Literature, which, however, he never completed. In numerous
essays and minor works he worked hard at various sections of such
a history, and his relative value as an initiator in that branch
cannot be disputed. The laborious works of K. M. Kertbény are purely
bibliographical, and as such, useful. His attempts were quite thrown
into the shade by the great works on Hungarian bibliography of Charles
Szabó, G. Petrik, and J. Szinnyei. The handiest and bibliographically
richest history of Hungarian Literature is that by Zsolt Beöthy (sixth
edition, 1892). Under Beöthy’s editorship a richly-illustrated history
of Hungarian Literature was published, in two volumes, in the year and
in honour of the Hungarian Millennium, 1896. Among the better writers of
monographs on literary history are Julius Zolnai (philology); J. Szinnyei
(biography); Sigism Simonyi (philologist); L. Négyessy (prosody); Alex.
Imre (popular humour and mediæval style); R. Radnai (history of Magyar
æsthetics); M. Csillagh (on Balassi); Sigism Bodnár (history of Hungarian
Literature); H. Lenkei (studies in Petőfi); K. Greska (on the epic of
Zrinyi); T. Szana (history of literature), etc.

The study of æsthetics has always been one of the favourite pursuits
of Magyar writers during the present century. The most conspicuous of
Hungarian students of æsthetics are Augustus Greguss and Paul Gyulai,
whose works have advanced not only Magyar views, but the study of
æsthetics in general.

The best known students of _Hungarian philology_ are John Fogarasi;
Joseph Lugossy; the late Sam. Brassai, who in his multifarious studies
reminds us of the great scholars of the seventeenth century; Paul
Hunfalvy, Joseph Budenz, Ferdinand Barna (Finnish philology); Gabriel
Szarvas and Sigismund Simonyi; and the well-known Arminius Vámbéry.

In the departments of _Science proper_ there has been very considerable
progress in Hungary during the last thirty years. Reports of the
general results of scientific researches made by Hungarians are also
published, for the greater convenience of the western nations, in special
periodicals written in German.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUNGARIAN LITERATURE ***




Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”

    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.

    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.

    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.


1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
